  <h2 class='c006'>THE TRIUMPH OF THE NUT<br> <span class='c010'><em>or</em></span><br> <span class='c011'>TOO MANY MARRIAGES</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>I</h3>

<p class='c013'>There was a man named Webster, who lived
in a town in the State of Wisconsin and he made
patent washing machines. He had a wife
named Mary and a daughter named Jane and
a stenographer named Natalie. And he used
to have dreams, which was no great matter until
he began to practise what he dreamed.</p>

<p class='c005'>And so there was this Webster, and then this
thing happened to him. He began to feel
strange feelings and movements within his
head, as though it were a newly wound watch.</p>

<p class='c005'>He found it hard to sit still in one spot and
impossible to sit still in two spots. So he
walked rapidly to and fro, in and out of office
and factory, and he thought: “Perhaps I am
becoming a little insane. But I like myself
better this way.” Which, considering what
kind of man he had been, was not strange.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>He stopped in front of Natalie and looked
hard at her. She looked hard, too, though not
at him. She just naturally looked hard because
she was a pretty hard case, in her own way.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suddenly it was clear to John Webster that
Natalie was not a woman. She was a house.
When she raised her eyes she raised the windows
of the house and when she raised her
voice she raised the roof. She was short and
broad—a bungalow, then, with no upper story
at all, nothing above the eaves.</p>

<p class='c005'>So then Natalie was a house, a new thought.
Probably other people were houses too; his own
wife, perhaps. He must look to see what kind
of a house she was. Was she an eligible family
residence, suitable for permanent occupancy,
or merely a boarding house, to be left at short
notice—if one preferred, let us say, a nice little
bungalow?</p>

<p class='c005'>And so there he was on his way home for
lunch and an inspection of his wife.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>II</h3>

<p class='c013'>Yes, both of them, wife and daughter, were
houses. Then he himself must be a house.
Houses should not wear clothes. He went up
to his room and <a id='t2'></a>took off all his clothes. He
stood before a mirror admiring his own naked
façade.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>What kind of house was he? A large
winged insect flew against the window screen
and crawled slowly toward the top. It spoke
with a little voice: “Let me in. I belong to your
house. Let me in.” That was the answer to
his question. “Bughouse! Positive, bug—comparative,
parasite—superlative, paresis,” he
murmured, and he smiled softly—so softly.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III</h3>

<p class='c013'>When he returned to the office he saw that
Natalie was changed. An amazing and lovely
thing had happened. Tears came into his eyes
and his knees felt as weak as his brain. He
crawled across the room on all fours and laid
his head in her lap.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Natalie, an amazing and lovely thing has
happened to you. You have had a bath,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How did you know?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, you look so pale, and, besides, I saw
the high water mark on the back of your neck,”
he said. “Where did you do this amazing and
lovely thing?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In a common washtub in mother’s shed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>How lovely it was that she had used a
common washtub instead of one of the patent
washing machines. They were so commercial,
so practical. But a common washtub, you see,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>is nearly related to the old oaken bucket and
reminds one of all the creeping, crawling,
swimming, jumping things that live in and
around wells.</p>

<p class='c005'>He could see them now, thousands of the
little creatures, going swiftly up and down
stairs, opening windows, laughing, crying, fighting,
and, especially, making love, without any
hampering rules, regulations, or restrictions.
It was too lovely.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Natalie,” he said, “I do not love my wife.
She is so fat. I will take a thousand dollars
and go away with you. Let who will make
patent washing machines. Henceforth, I will
only make love.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Now this Natalie, you see, was a notable
dumbbell and so she said nothing. All she
thought was that a thousand dollars would take
a lot of spending and she might as well go
along.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IV</h3>

<p class='c013'>As you will remember, John Webster had
begun to dislike his clothes. They were, you
see, ready-made clothes. Hence one should not
be surprised at the strange nightly ceremony
begun in his room.</p>

<p class='c005'>He set up a picture of the Virgin between
two yellow candles. Then he undressed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>walked naked up and down the room for hours
at a time, thinking great thoughts.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I used to be a dull clod. Now I am a shining
nut. I am cracked and my shell is off. I
am a lovely study in psychopathy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why should I work, making uninteresting
washing machines? I will become a writer.
Among them I shall not be strange, for there
are many nuts among the writers. They write
books like this and get away with it. Many
people will think this is a deep, philosophical
book, that it throws a new and fierce light upon
the problems of civilization. Whereas it is
simply a medical document, a study of a certain
common form of insanity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I will write books like this book, but they
shall throw a fiercer light on the problems of
civilization, for I will make my hero run naked
in the streets. All nuts of this particular variety
do that when they are fully ripe. My book
will be a devastating book and it will have
Sherwood Anderson and Krafft-Ebing faded.”</p>

<p class='c005'>There he was, you see, John Webster, night
after night, walking naked up and down his
room, thinking great thoughts.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>V</h3>

<p class='c013'>One night his wife could no longer restrain
her vain and morbid curiosity as to what he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>doing, walking so up and down in his room. He
saw the door to her room open an inch. At
the same time his daughter’s door similarly
opened. In a moment he had disposed himself
for the great scene.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come in,” he called. There was a commanding
ring in his voice. “Come in, both of
you, and sit there on the bed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Pale, frightened, cowed, those wretched
women, who had never had great thoughts,
came in. There was John Webster, naked,
seated on the top of a dresser, crosslegged, like
an obscene Buddha, a lighted candle in each
hand. They made for the bed and fell prostrate,
burying their faces in the bed-clothes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Jane,” he began, addressing his daughter, “I
do not love that woman there, your mother and
my wife. When our marriage transpired——”</p>

<p class='c005'>A muffled groan from Jane stopped him.
“Occurred, father,” she moaned. “Occurred,
not transpired. Don’t you know the difference
in the meaning of the words?”</p>

<p class='c005'>He ignored the interruption. “She was
lovely, tall, straight, and slim. Her hair was
golden yellow. Now she is homely, fat, and
generally unattractive. Her hair is rather colorless.
No free, unrestrained animal would continue
to love such a mate. I intend to be like
other animals. So I am going to leave this
house and live with Natalie.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“In a short time, doubtless, I shall leave her
in turn and find another, and so on until I am
overtaken by death or the police.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I want you to know about this plan of
mine. There are too many marriages. There
should be many matings, free and frequent.
But of marriages, few or none. This is the key
to unlock the fetters of civilization. It is Sherwood
Anderson’s answer to the riddle of
existence, else this book, in which we live, has
no meaning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For hours he talked, describing to his
daughter all the ugly aspects of her mother’s
body and mind, all the sordid incidents of
their married life that his memory could recall
or his imagination furnish. It was a quite
lovely experience for both women.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he dressed, packed his bag, and left the
house, his wife took a few ounces of laudanum
and ceased to exist.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VI</h3>

<p class='c013'>Through the silent, deserted streets toward
the railroad station John Webster walked with
his new woman, Natalie, the Beautiful Washing
Machine Girl. He walked with one foot on
the curb and one in the gutter. Up and down
he went, as with alternate step he now rose
toward heaven on the higher foot, now sank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>toward earth on the lower. It pleased him
to walk thus. It seemed to typify the conflict
of life, the struggle between the higher and
lower natures. Natalie, carrying both bags,
wept unceasingly, but inaudibly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That is fine,” thought John Webster. “She
weeps with dignity. But she walks with both
feet on the sidewalk.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, woman,” he said. “Walk as I do,
with one foot in the gutter. That will do for a
starter. Both of them and all the rest of you
will be in the gutter, when I am through with
you. Better get used to it gradually.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Natalie, still weeping, audibly now, obeyed.
And so there in the darkness of the night, John
Webster and his <em>pro tempore</em> soul mate, Natalie,
the congenital dumbbell, went on their way, up
and down, up and down, one foot in the gutter,
one on the curb.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VII</h3>

<p class='c013'>They came to where narrow strips of grass
bordered the sidewalk. These gave John Webster
a new and glorious thought.</p>

<p class='c005'>“See the grass strips!” he cried; “the beautiful
grass strips! All flesh is grass; therefore,
let us strip also.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He began, unsystematically but vigorously,
enthusiastically, to remove his clothing. Natalie’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>weeping now lost all its dignity. She
bellowed enormously. She woke the echoes and
a policeman.</p>

<p class='c005'>And, so you see, there is John Webster in a
great house maintained by the State of Wisconsin
for all who think such great thoughts.
He is free from the worries of women, wives
and washing machines; carefree in all respects
save one—his straitjacket is obviously a ready-made
garment.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>I</h3>

<p class='c013'>“We have been married exactly fifty-four
minutes,” said Maurice, “and I still love you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can’t believe it!” answered Eleanor.</p>

<p class='c005'>As she was thirty-nine and he nineteen, her
incredulity was not strange, but, after all, fifty-four
minutes lacks a full six minutes of being
an hour.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were islanded in rippling tides of windblown
grass, with the warm fragrance of dropping
locust blossoms enfolding them and in
their ears the endless murmur of the river.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We must spend our golden wedding here,
under this tree,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>She made a mental calculation. She was
twice his age. At their golden wedding he
would be sixty-nine and she twice that—one
hundred and thirty-eight! It seemed hopeless.
Would it last forever? Such a little thing
might—<em>throw the switches</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Six minutes had elapsed. “I wish,” said
Maurice very low in his mind, “I wish I could
die, right now!” <i><span lang="la">Tempus, edax amoris!</span></i></p>

<h3 class='c014'>II</h3>

<p class='c013'>She had said “No!” six times. Consider her
age! Consider that she was a music-teacher
and suffered from indigestion! Consider, moreover,
that the author of her being had failed
to give her any last name and here was her
opportunity to fill the gap! This, then, was
certainly an heroic defense of an untenable
position. At the seventh time of asking, she
capitulated—more to be pitied than blamed.</p>

<p class='c005'>She sang with a voice of serene sweetness.
Otherwise she was a creature of alluring
silences. They fascinated Maurice. He was
sure that behind her white forehead beautiful,
mysterious thoughts were evolving. Perhaps
that was so. Evolution is a notoriously slow
process. On the other hand, behind that white
forehead there may have been merely one full
portion of the great cosmic void. Judging her
by what she verbally disclosed, her rating under
the Binet test was D−.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was not a well woman. Besides indigestion,
she was suffering from another chronic
illness, <em>detropitis</em>. She did not know it yet.
She had not met Maurice’s other half. She was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>his better half, but Edith was his other half—a
very different thing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Edith and Maurice were fashioned for each
other. They had been so carefully forged and
shaped that they fitted each other like a pair
of scissors. Anything that came between them
was—<i><span lang="fr">de trop</span></i> and likely to get hurt.</p>

<p class='c005'>Moreover, she was, unknowingly, now exposing
herself to her final, her fatal malady. The
place of their fifty-four minute honeymoon had
been rashly, inconsiderately chosen. This
riverside paradise was unlucky for her. Death
was already shaking the bones for the final
throw—though its double-sixes did not fall for
ten years. All in all, she was not a well woman.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III</h3>

<p class='c013'>Maurice’s Uncle Henry and Aunt Mary
took them in until Maurice could get a job.
Uncle Henry’s wife counted every cigar he
smoked, yet he maintained his cheerfulness. He
reminded one somewhat of Mark Tapley, somewhat
of Moses, but mostly of William James—the
Pragmatic Sanction justified everything to
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aunt Mary was of distinguished lineage,
descendant of the late Lydia Pinkham and of
the late Ralph Waldo Emerson. She inherited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the Pinkham physique, the Emerson mentality.</p>

<p class='c005'>Edith, their daughter, was eleven. She and
Maurice had a wonderful time playing tag and
pussy-in-a-corner, while Eleanor sat on the
porch with the other old folks and had a wonderful
time being jealous of Edith.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maurice! don’t get overheated, darling!
Look out! you’ll  tear your panties and mamma
will have to spank. Maurice! come  sit by
mamma and she’ll show you how to play cat’s-cradle.
Maurice, dear! You mustn’t play with
that rough, rude tom-boy. Come, let mamma
tell you Bible stories.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It worried Maurice. Seeking distraction, he
developed an interest in poultry. He shingled
the chicken-coop and then crawled in and sat
among the chickens debating whether Eleanor
was an old hen. After observing them for some
time, he found that hens never nagged the
cockerels. She was not an old hen!</p>

<p class='c005'>Apparently slight causes have such momentous
effects! He had developed an interest in
chickens. He little knew whither it was to
lead him.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IV</h3>

<p class='c013'>Maurice got a job in a real-estate office and
at once became a real force in the business.
He devised a new method of making sales. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>consisted in pointing out to prospective purchasers
the defects in the houses he was trying
to sell.</p>

<p class='c005'>If a house had a broken-down heater, an
antiquated plumbing system and a leaky roof,
Maurice would take the client into his confidence
and tell him frankly that there was a
broken window-pane in the attic, a creaky
board in the dining-room floor and several
scratches in the paint of the guest-room door.
Such frankness was most beguiling. The client
was beguiled into examining, under Maurice’s
guidance, the attic window and the guest-room
door, and forgot to look at the heater and the
roof.</p>

<p class='c005'>Houses which had been the despair of the
office were sold, one after another. They gave
him three cheers and the nickname of “G. R. Q.
Wallingford.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>V</h3>

<p class='c013'>Their attempt at housekeeping failed.
Although Eleanor had hired a very deaf old
scrubwoman to do the cooking, somehow
the food wasn’t properly prepared. After
Maurice had broken a tooth on one of her
soft-boiled eggs, they gave it up and went to
boarding.</p>

<p class='c005'>They had a nice third-story room, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>black-marble mantelpiece, an antique carpet
and steel engravings of Lincoln’s Cabinet and
Daniel Webster. It was a dear little lovenest.
Every evening Maurice played solitaire
on a marble-topped table. She put on an old
wrapper, let down her hair, made it all nice
and stringy with cologne, lay down on the bed
and moaned. They were three years married
now. He was twenty-two, she was going on
for about sixty-six.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Star, why do you moan?” he asked gently.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You’re tired of me, Maurice. You don’t
love me,” she moaned. “I’m jealous.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of whom,” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of Edith, of your Aunt Mary, of your stenographer,
of our landlady, of the schoolteacher
downstairs, of our late cook, of
everybody.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Moan—moan—moan. “Jealousy isn’t a vice.
It’s my favorite indoor sport. I love you—I
love you so.” Moan—moan—moan. “Tell me
you love me, Maurice.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I do—yes, of course, naturally, I love you—devotedly,
madly.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You don’t love me! You don’t love me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He threw the table at her. She screamed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Excuse me, dearest, for an hour or two.
I forgot something.” He took his hat and went
out. All the lights went out....</p>

<p class='c005'><em>The switches were thrown....</em></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>VI</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Lily Dale was a little thing, with exquisite
features, a pretty, laughing face and amber
eyes. She was a lover of flowers, a neat housekeeper,
a good cook. She was honest, cheerful,
self-reliant, humorous. In fact, she was a great
deal better than she should be, considering what
she was. In the entire category of virtues she
lacked only two, grammar and—the title rôle.</p>

<p class='c005'>In her little flat she cooked a steak for
Maurice better than any he’d had since he
was married—and made a cup of coffee to
match it. She put him in a big chair before
an open fire, with a hyacinth on the table beside
him. She sat on a hassock by him, smoked
cigarettes and told him funny stories&#160;... and
Maurice discovered why men leave home....</p>

<p class='c005'>Maurice had a wonderful idea. He and
Eleanor would again go to housekeeping and
install Lily in the kitchen. Lily would be saved
and they’d have a good cook. Then Eleanor
could lie on the bed upstairs and moan all the
evening, while he and Lily made fudge in the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My wife’s very broad-minded,” he said,
“and we need a cook awful bad.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ain’t you the funny little feller!” said Lily.
“Here, you run along home to mother. The
old lady’ll think you got stole or something....”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Eleanor awaited him in their room. “Maurice,
dear! Where’ve you been?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To see a chicken. You know my interest
in poultry. (Thank God! that’s no lie)....”</p>

<p class='c005'>But whenever he wanted a good cup of coffee,
he had to go back to the little flat....</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VII</h3>

<p class='c013'>Little Jacky Dale was six years old when
Eleanor first learned of his existence. She happened
not to be lying on the bed at the time,
so she fainted first—then went to bed.</p>

<p class='c005'>There were dumb days when she went about
like an automaton. Days when she sat at the
window and looked at the bare branches of
the trees, the dead stalks of the lilies—the
river! Sometimes she was almost able to
think. Then a return to normality—blank listlessness.
Sometimes she seemed to hear a
whisper in her mind—but it was only an echo
in the void.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the days passed and each day she dredged
the silences of her cranium for thoughts—none!
But at last, after two years of listening to
echoes and dredging silences—an idea came to
her! It was the first she’d ever had! The
shock of it took her breath away, stunned her!
But there it was, her first-born idea! A little
idiotic, perhaps, but her own!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>She went to the house on Maple Street,
where Lily lived.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sell me Jacky! I’ll give you six hundred
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sell Jacky for six hundred dollars! I ain’t
no cheap trader!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s all I’ve got.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you needn’t come around. If that’s
all you’ve got, you’d better get.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She got.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VIII</h3>

<p class='c013'>A failure! Her little first-born idea had flivvered!
Would she ever have another? Yes!
She had another almost immediately—of the
same kind. She must keep Maurice from marrying
Edith and to do that it was necessary—not
for her to live. No, that would be good for
only twenty or twenty-five years or maybe
thirty—if she lived to be eighty. Maurice
would be only sixty then and Edith fifty and
they might still marry.</p>

<p class='c005'>She must do better than that. He must
marry Lily! Lily would live at least fifty
years more. By that time Maurice would surely
be dead and Edith foiled, forever. She, herself,
must die at once so Maurice might marry
Lily....</p>

<p class='c015'>It was the place of their honeymoon. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the river looked wet! Suppose it was? Her
skirts would get wet! To keep her coat dry
she left it on the bank. Her hat? She’d
wear that to keep her hair dry.</p>

<p class='c005'>Feet in the water, ankle deep! It <em>was</em> wet!
Oh, bother! Above her knees now! Still wet—such
a nuisance! She fell full length! Wet all
over!!! She couldn’t stand that! That was too
much of a wetness! No, no, she’d better go

<h3 class='c012'>I</h3>

<p class='c013'>Lee Clavering’s weary eyes—steel-blue,
half closed—roved over the darkened auditorium.</p>

<p class='c005'>Twelve years ago he had migrated from pre-civil-war
Louisiana to Manhattan, the Brains of
America—from the ante-bellum to the cerebellum.
In that time he had attained the highest
position in the gift of the nation. Poets,
playwrights, players, painters, pugilists, politicians,
prophets, priests, popes, presidents,
princes and pullman-car porters cringed before
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was L. C., the premier columnist of
America, the King Kleagle of the Kolyumist
Klan.</p>

<p class='c005'>His long dark face suggested the cynical, the
mysterious, the morose. But his steel-blue
eyes were now, as always, searching, with the
evergreen hope of finding <em>the</em> consummate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>woman, which proves him really romantic.
That he found her in a New York first-night
audience proves him a character in fiction.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>II</h3>

<p class='c013'>She sat two seats ahead of him. After the
first act, she rose to her feet, turned toward
him and, with her opera glasses, swept the
house.</p>

<p class='c005'>“European,” Clavering clicked. “All of them
are—these sweepers and scrubwomen.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The columnist spoke. The man took a second
look—and saw that Venus rising from the
sea had nothing on her (emphasis on <em>her</em>,
please!)—the most exquisitely beautiful woman
he had ever seen—the only authentic consummate
woman, indubitably.</p>

<p class='c005'>Clavering’s nerves rippled, but the man next <a id='t21'></a>to
him—old Dinwiddie, swell, suave and sixty—had
an apoplectic fit. His eyes bulged. His lips
gibbered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a ghost—Mary Ogden—belle of New
York forty-five years ago, when I was a kid—married
Count Zattiany—Hungarian—never
been back since——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Her daughter, of course,” suggested
Clavering.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never had any—to speak of—but that’s it—must
be—one of the unmentionables—she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>a gay one—little liaison now and then—relished
by the best of men——”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III</h3>

<p class='c013'>Three weeks passed—six more “first-nights”—and
“Mary Ogden” was at every one of them,
also Lee Clavering. She was “the talk of the
town.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The newspapers were full of the mystery.
Who was this enthralling person? Crowds followed
her everywhere. She bought a pair of
gloves—and seven floor-walkers were hurried
to Bellevue in seven separate deliria. She
went into the Public Library—and the infatuated
populace carried off all the books as
souvenirs. She walked around the reservoir—and
they drew off the water and sold it for
a dollar a bottle.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the theater they turned the footlights
around and threw the spotlights on her. Nobody
looked at the stage. The actors forgot
their parts, switched from the first act of
“The Demi-Vierge” to the second act of “Pollyanna”
and no one noticed it, but the author.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the second Sunday, forty per cent of all
the clergymen preached on “Mary has chosen
the better part.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Never had there been such excitement in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Manhattan since Peter Stuyvesant broke his
wooden leg.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IV</h3>

<p class='c013'>After the sixth “first-night,” Lee Clavering
followed her home. He found her alone in the
great city, on her own doorstep.</p>

<p class='c005'>“May I?—Am I?—Are you?—Were they?—Was
it?—Whoosis?—” he stammered, his
temperature rising dangerously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,” she said with a faint smile, “I’m locked
out——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Watch me!” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>He tore out the area railing and threw it at
a passing taxicab, smashed the area windows, <a id='t23'></a>and
burst in the door. Entering, he ran rapidly
through the house, switched on all the lights,
turned on the hot and cold water in every
bathroom, upset the furniture and slid down
the banisters from the fourth story to the first.
Landing in a heap at the bottom, he leaped to
his feet and opened the front door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Thank you,” she said simply. “Have a
drink, Mr. Clavering?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You know whom I am, then?” he cyrilled in
amazement.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Certainly. Don’t you?” she answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I—yes—no—” he murmured, his eyes fixed
on her, as he poured a drink.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“That’s the catsup bottle—and do you always
drink from a finger bowl?” she asked sweetly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, invariably never,” he gasped. “I
mean—inevitably always——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You make me sit up—and take notice,” he
columned feebly, seating himself on the overturned
victrola.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You will pardon my confusion,” he babbled
on. “To who—I mean, to wit have I the honor
of speaking? How old are you? Have you ever
been married? If so, mark a cross within the
circle, but not within the triangle—if not, was
your husband present when the body was
found? If you have any children not in jail,
how do you account for it? Who <em>are</em> you, and
if not, what <em>is</em> your beautiful name? Answer
yes or no.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Marie Zattiany,” she answered, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Legitimate or ill—” he paused in midflight,
dipped his forefinger into the catsup and
dreamily drew a red cross on his shirt-front.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pardon me,” he continued, “I was about to
ask a personal question. To speak quite impersonally—will
you marry me?—if you’re of
marriageable age.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How old do you think I am? Don’t answer.
You’d certainly either flatter me nauseatingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>or insult me grossly. Come back in three weeks
and I will tell you my story.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She raised her hand for him to kiss, but he
ducked and she missed him by an inch.</p>

<p class='c005'>Outside the house, he remembered the shattered
basement-windows. His southern chivalry
would not let him leave her unprotected.
He lay down on the doorstep and slept
soundly until dawn.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>V</h3>

<p class='c013'>A column a day keeps the sheriff away and
when you’ve got the habit, you keep right on,
no matter what your feelings are—or your

with fortitude.</p>

<p class='c005'>The make-up seldom varied. It must open
with a poem, preferably an authentic L. C.
Horatian ode. His odometer registered three
a week. It was his line—“master of the
Horatian line,” he had been called. As thus:</p>

office, there half an hour pasting contribs’ contribs
to make a full column and amazed to find how
short my stint, but with no lack of pleasure or
content. Having nothing now in my mind of
trouble in the world, did sit and think on many
things. So to lunch with H. Broun, my fellow
scrivener and a very pleasant fellow withal, though
me thought me had heard before some of the bright
sayings of his little son, wherewith he regaled me.
Thence to the game or play of base-ball, as well
played as ever I saw in my life. Thence to tea
with Mistress Myssa McMynn, with much merriment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>and wit. Thence to dinner with F. Adams, the
satyrickal writer, H. Canby, the excellent critick,
C. Morley, the literary philosopher, D. Marquis, the

a masque entitled “The Follies,” to my great content.
Thence to supper with W. Rogers, the
antick player, and found him very intelligent,

<p class='c013'>Three weeks passed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“To-night’s the night,” he cried, rushed from
his apartment, plunged recklessly between automobiles
going in four different directions at
once—obviously Fords—sprang upon the roof
of a passing taxicab and told the man to drive
like hell for Park Avenue.</p>

<p class='c005'>He charged up the steps, assaulted the door
with his fists, leap-frogged over the impassive
butler. He found her in the library and forced
the fighting from the start.</p>

<p class='c005'>It seemed to her that her entire body was
encircled by flexible hot bars of iron and that
her face, her mouth, were being flagellated.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Break away!” she managed to gurgle.
“No biting in the clinches!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Who are you?” he cried. “I don’t want to
know! Will you marry me? Don’t answer!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again she was submerged. When she was
coming up for the third time, he pushed her
head under once more. A left hook to the jaw
and he collapsed under a table.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he came to, his voice was weak.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A typewriter, please!” he gasped. “It’s
stuff for the column.” His news sense rarely
failed him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tuesday, October 29th—I to M. Zattiany’s,
the toast of the town, and a mighty mystery,
whether she be in truth Zattiany or a mischievous
impostor, and did kiss and clip her
mightily, but the baggage handed me a slapp
on the mapp, as a trunk had fallen on me. So
I to the mat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What next?” he added feebly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have a drink,” she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>He took three.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who are you, woman? Is your real name
Zattiany or Firpo?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am Mary Ogden Zattiany,” she answered
quietly; “I married Zattiany forty-five years
ago. I was twenty-five at the time. Do your
own arithmetic.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Five from thirty is twenty and carry two—twice
two is five divided by forty—double it
and subtract the cube root—think of a number,
add a dash of bitters—shake well before using”—his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>voice trailed to silence and his jaw
dropped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I hated Zattiany but his position appealed to
my love of power and intrigue—especially the
latter. I was besieged by men—and surrendered
at discretion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He got suddenly to his feet. “Think I’ll
take few more drinks.” He did so and then
sat down on the floor, a full glass in either
hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I had many lovers—many—many—many—”
she went on.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Bow-wow-wow!” he barked a short laugh.</p>

<p class='c005'>He gazed at her with relaxing features.
His steel-blue eyes goggled sardonically.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of all my lovers, I loved but one, Prince
Haffanauer, the last. But he married and left
me flat.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lef’ your flat? Thought you lived in
palazzo.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s so,” she echoed. “I did until the
war came.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Scuse me pers’nal queshion, Mis’ Zattiany,
but have you sat in any these genelmen’s
laps lately?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not since Haffanauer,” she answered pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tha’s long time—thirty minutes,” he
ruminated. “That’s all ri’. Proceed!”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“I was sixty-five when Haffanauer—elapsed,
so to speak.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But you’re young woman now. Please
’splain that—simple queshion—how do you
did it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Coué!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, I won’ go ’way—not tell you till me—till
you tell me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Coué! Coué! Emile Coué!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Are you singin’ song or jes’ making funny
noises?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, you know! Every day in every way—younger
and younger.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sure, I know! Every day Coee, Cooay, he
chortled in his joy! Alice Swunderland.
S’Lewis Carroll—great columnist—my cousin—same
’nitials.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was sixty-eight when I took the cure.
Every day I’ve been getting younger and
younger—<em>in every way</em>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Better stop, lady!” he said solemnly. “Some
kid now, but—much younger—police in’erfere.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well—that is my story. Do you—do you
love me still?” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Scuse me, ’nother pers’nal queshion.
<em>D’you make zis hooch?</em>”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’En I <em>do</em> love your still. Old as you are,

<p class='c005'>And then he slept as quietly as a child.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VII</h3>

<p class='c013'>Three weeks passed—three weeks of constant
companionship with Lee Clavering—almost
exhausting her capacity for surprise and
her cellar. Then, a wireless telegram—“Wife
dead must see you immediately on arrival
Berengaria Haffanauer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Prince arrived—straight, thin, erect,
broke—in his eyes the glance of the Austrian
double-eagle, now selling at 99⁴⁴⁄₁₀₀ off for
cash.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Frau Gräfin.” He lifted her hand to his
lips with princely courtesy. “Younger than
when I first saw you. Couéing, they tell me—and
billing, as well—is it not so?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why are you here, Excellenz?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Because Austria needs you—I need you.
We need you every hour and—every dollar.
Will you marry me?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But I am engaged to L. C.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What of that? Let me state my case. I
am about to rehabilitate Austria. My plans
are simple but comprehensible by the meanest
intelligence—only. I shall annex Germany,
Italy, Greece, Turkey, Moldavia, Bolivia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Rumania, Pneumonia, the Jugo and Czecho
brothers and all the Balking States. I shall
create a Barnum, Bailey and Ringling Brothers
Austria—bigger and better than ever.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you?” he went on, “you shall be—what
you will—queen, empress, my m—er—morganatic
wife. The Oesterreich shall shed
its plumes for your adornment—if only you’ll
buy a little preferred with a large bonus of
very common.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Old stuff!” she exclaimed disdainfully. “I
have the same plan. I shall do it myself—with
the aid of my husband’s column—I,
Marie, Countess Zattiany!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“But, no,” he answered. “Return to Austria
as Mrs. Lee Clavering and you’ll be cut by
every true-born Austrich. We recognize no one
without sixteen quarterings—and a few hangings
and drawings.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What?” she stared aghast. “Mrs. Lee—?
Shall I have to take my husband’s name? Isn’t
the Lucy Stone League too powerful——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not in Austria,” he said blandly. “No
League whether of Nations or denominations
is recognized.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I love him so!” she moaned. “But this
changes everything. I will never give up the
gräfinship. Moritz! I am yours!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sign on the dotted line,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Opine,” answered Susy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good Lord!” exclaimed Nick.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not?” she asked, amazed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why it isn’t done, my dear. Really it
isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a perfectly good word,” pouted Susy.
“Prior used it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Prior, yes, but not since,” said he. “It has
had priority but not permanency. Obsolete, my
dear—archaic. Begin again.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right. How’s this?——”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>I</h3>

<p class='c013'>“The moon—their tutelary orb——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tutelary orb! Oh, dear!” groaned Nick.
“Why don’t you say ‘chaste goddess of the
night!’ ‘sweet regent of the heavens!’ ‘queen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and huntress, chaste and fair!’ or something
new like that? This is modern English prose,
my dear Susy. Here, let me have the typewriter.
I’ll show you how.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>I</h3>

<p class='c013'>Nick Lansing lived in a three-pair-back bed
sitting-room. An industrious young man, he
worked day and night. In the daytime he
worked, writing part of a popular encyclopedia—V
to X, a most depressing section of the
alphabet. At night he worked his rich friends
for dinners, the opera, drinks and cigars, a
more agreeable job.</p>

<p class='c005'>Susy Branch was also a prominent member
of the I. W. W. She worked everybody, day
and night, all the time, for everything—clothes,
shoes, hats, board, lodging and
laundry.</p>

<p class='c005'>In spite of their industry, both were poor.
Nick was poor as he could be—which, considering
Nick’s capacity for poverty—is saying
something. Susy was poorer than she could be—and
be satisfied—which, considering her
tastes and appetites, isn’t saying so much. Still,
the fact is she hadn’t a red—outside of her
vanity-case.</p>

<p class='c005'>And so they were married. By the Interposition
of Authorship they were brought together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>at the almost equally poor Fulmers’ tiny cottage
in the wilds of New Hampshire, where Nat
Fulmer painted the Italian cook on the veranda,
Grace Fulmer played the fiddle in the dining-room
and the five Fulmer kids raised hell simultaneously
all over the place. The romance of
married love in a cottage swept Susy off her
feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was Susy’s idea. Nick would never have
thought of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why not us get married?” she asked quite
simply.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nick was frightened, shied, might have run
away, but Susy was on the job with a plan—blue-prints,
specifications and working-drawings
all complete—especially the last. Susy
was a fast worker.</p>

<p class='c005'>In six words, the gist of it was “checks,
nothing but checks, for wedding-presents.”
The word “checks”—in the plural—rooted
Nicky to the spot. “Lead me to them!” cried
every fibre in his body.</p>

<p class='c005'>The whole thing was simple enough. Susy
would guarantee the checks. It should be
understood of all that it would be bad form to
give Nick and Susy anything but checks, drafts
or orders for the payment of money—this
their spending-money. For the rest, everyone
would lend them their spare houses, palazzos,
cottages, villas, apartments, servants, food,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>wine, cigars and cigarettes—board and lodging
free for a year at least. Susy would guarantee
<em>that</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>And that’s all they had to look out for—one
year. After that, why, either of them might
make a better match—both of them probably.
One little hand-made divorce would do for
both....</p>

<p class='c005'>“I should like just for once to have something
of my very own, Nicky dear—something
that nobody had lent me, like my fancy-dresses,
motors, opera cloaks—or given me, like everything
else. And the divorce would be my own,
wouldn’t it, Nicky? Mine and yours, just our
owny own little divorce.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Checks!” murmured Nicky, still in a
trance. “Checks!”...</p>

<h3 class='c014'>II</h3>

<p class='c013'>It rose for them—the moon—their tutelary
orb, if you prefer to put it that way, as indeed
you may, goodness knows, some do—over
Como, Streffy’s villa, marble balustrades,
stephanotis, gardenias, nightingales, and
Streffy’s cigars....</p>

<p class='c005'>But now their month was ended. They were
packing for the next on their string, Vanderlyn’s
palazzo in Venice, equally well found.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The new tenant’s motor has come,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Susy gaily, “and I’ve bribed the chauffeur to
drive us to Milan. It’s so much cheaper than
railway fares.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Clever of you!” Nicky laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And I’ve packed all the rest of Streffy’s
cigars.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Streffy’s cigars?” Lansing stared, aghast.
“<em>Streffy’s cigars!</em> Oh, my God! Give me the
key, woman!”...</p>

<p class='c005'>He worked half an hour over the refractory
lock, perspired, broke his finger-nails, disinterred
them at last. Then he jumped into the
motor and they were whirling through the nightingale-thickets
to the gates.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why did you leave the cigars, dear?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course, you don’t understand, darling,”
he answered gently. “No woman knows anything
about cigars. Streffy never bought those
cigars, dear. <em>They were given to him.</em> Thank
God! Vanderlyn buys his own cigars....”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III</h3>

<p class='c013'>At the palazzo, a letter from Ellie Vanderlyn
awaited Susy, containing four other letters
addressed to “Nelson Vanderlyn, Esqre., New
York City.” Susy read:</p>

<p class='c005'>“One good turn deserves another&#160;... you
and Nick can stay all summer&#160;... no expense—servants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>have orders&#160;... just post these
letters, one a week&#160;... be good to my
child....”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was too plain!... vile!... infamous!... a child left behind&#160;... abominable!...
for her to take care of&#160;... outrageous!...
She would never do it&#160;... they must leave this
place at once....</p>

<p class='c015'>But she awoke next morning to the sun shining
through curtains of old brocade, making a
network of golden scales upon the vaulted
ceiling—to a luxurious breakfast in bed and a
single tea-rose in an old Murano glass—and
thought of—the child! How could she leave a
lonely child exposed to all the evils of such a
pampered infancy? Distasteful as it was to
dwell in the palazzo of the ungodly—it was her
duty&#160;... and she did. The letters went in
due course to N. Vanderlyn, Esqre.</p>

<p class='c015'>Charlie Strefford arrived wearing a mouldy
Panama hat, reminiscent of the Stilton cheese
of old England—an eccentricity pardonable in
the next-but-two to the Earldom of Altringham—only
the present incumbent and his son intervening.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good old Streffy!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where’s old Nick?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“He’s writing, you know. Works all day on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>a philosophic romance—like <em>Marius</em>, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, I say!—good one!” laughed Streffy.
“Nick’s <em>Marius</em>—<em>you</em> marry <em>me</em>—see? Capital!—Eh,
what? Rath-er! Countess of
Altringham—what? Altringham and son sure
to die soon‘—’bout middle of the book—accident
in hunting field or yacht capsizes in the Solent—sure
to—always happens—one or other—absolutely.
Think it over, old thing....”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IV</h3>

<p class='c013'>Ellie Vanderlyn came back&#160;... but only to
be off again to St. Moritz, leaving Nick and
Susy undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good-by, you dear thing,” to Nicky. “I
must thank you for helping me to be so happy
elsewhere—you and Susy were such bricks
about the letters.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She left him a morocco case, in it a pearl
scarf pin. He sought Susy. She hurried to
him. She pressed the button of the lamp. Her
husband’s face started out of the twilight&#160;...
fortunately stopped before it had entirely left
him&#160;... then hardened. On her outstretched
wrist was a bracelet of emeralds and brilliants.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Look, dearest—wasn’t it darling of Ellie,”
she cried.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, she gave me this.” He opened the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>morocco case. “But yours cost more. Will you
tell me why she values your services higher
than mine? Don’t you know that men demand
and receive higher wages than women? My
position as head of the family&#160;... it’s humiliating&#160;... it’s.... I don’t know what to
say.... I’m all het up.... I’ll have to go
for a tramp....”</p>

<p class='c005'>And he left her&#160;... just like that.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>V</h3>

<p class='c013'>None was to be found in all Venice, nor in
Milan, nor in Genoa, whither his hopeless quest
had led him. Lazzaroni a-plenty&#160;... but in
all Italy, it seemed, there was not one real,
honest-to-God, good old-fashioned American
tramp....</p>

<p class='c005'>... But he did find Coral Hicks....</p>

<p class='c015'>There, in the harbor, was the huge outline
of the Hickses’ yacht, the <em>Ibis</em>&#160;... within the
outline was the <em>Ibis</em> itself. Nick knew it well.
He had bummed his board and lodging on it
for five months once in the good old days before
Susy and the checks had mesmerized him.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was something so restful about the
Hickses, so substantial, so solvent. Good old
Papa and Mamma Hicks, solid three-dimensional
people.... Papa, especially, had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>wonderful figure—one large digit, backed by six
ciphers and a decimal point.</p>

<p class='c005'>He could see them now, with their entourage—two
secretaries, a doctor, a maiden lady
known as Eldorada Tooker—though why so
called, unless to supply Comic Relief, no one
could say—and Coral, sole daughter of their
house and heart, that still unmarried child of
opulence.</p>

<p class='c005'>One large digit, backed by six ciphers and
a decimal point, contrasted with a small bank
balance, backed by Susy’s grandmother’s pearl
necklace&#160;... what about that? He knew
they would have to cast the pearls before the
wolf, if they were to hang together much longer....
Susy would have to choose between her
Nicholas and her necklace.... Was it
right?... Was it fair to Susy to burden her
longer?... The year was almost up....
Why not resign now—while the <em>Ibis</em> was at
hand?... <em>tutissimus Ibis</em>!</p>

<p class='c005'>He picked up the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>, ran his eye
casually down its columns and read:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tragic Yachting Accident in the Solent.
The Earl of Altringham and his son, Viscount
d’Amblay, drowned.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VI</h3>

<p class='c013'>Coral Hicks was a young lady of compact
if not graceful outline, with a downright manner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>also a little black down right on her upper
lip. She shanghaied unresisting Nick and the
<em>Ibis</em> sailed away....</p>

<p class='c005'>Sitting beside him on deck, she suddenly
said:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Your wife hasn’t written you for weeks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, thank the Lord!” he laughed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And you haven’t written her.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then you’re free. Will you take a new
job? Will you be my—secretary?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear Coral,” he replied, “this is so
sudden. No, I cannot. I do not love you in
that way, dearest. It’s too much like work.
But I will be a husband to you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>From the next port he wired his wife:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hereby tender resignation my position your
husband stop pearls beautiful but Coral more
durable stop recommend Streff my successor go
to it kid—don’t stop.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VII</h3>

<p class='c013'>Susy wired Streffy:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Congratulations old bean nice name Altringham
been thinking it over Nick has quit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She received an answer:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Meet me at the fountain Versailles
Friday”....</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“So Nicky did a bunk, eh?” Streffy chuckled.
“I say, that’s top-hole, what? How about little
old me? Countess, you know&#160;... places, no
end.... Altringham and the others.... If
you don’t like the others, we’ll see about altering
’em.... I say, how’s that? Pretty good, eh?&#160;... better take me on, old thing? What?...”</p>

<p class='c015'>Casually running their eyes down the columns
of the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>, as was their wont, Nick,
Streffy, Susy and Coral read:</p>

<p class='c005'>“A divorce has been arranged and will shortly
take place between Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas
Lansing.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VIII</h3>

<p class='c013'>They were at tea on the terrace of the Castle,
the Earle and Countess of Altringham (<i><span lang="fr">née</span></i>
Branch) and their week-end guests, Mr. and
Mrs. Nicholas Lansing (<i><span lang="fr">née</span></i> Hicks), all merry
and bright.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nicky, dear, did you read the funny story
they’ve written about us?” asked Susy gaily.
“Of course not. I’d forgotten you’ve given up
books entirely. Well, it’s simply killing. You
see, I’m supposed to turn Streffy down and then,
of all things, get a job as child’s nurse for—you’d
never guess—<em>the five Fulmer kids</em>—remember
that awful bunch?—can you imagine
me?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Then you do the same to Coral—isn’t that
the limit?—you turning down Coral! Imagination?
Well, I guess yes. And you come
bumbling round and it’s all on again—no
divorce at all. Think of it!—and we go off
with all the Fulmer kids, for a second honeymoon
at—this is the top-notch!—at Fontainebleau—cheap
hotel—awful restaurants. And,
then, I suppose, we live happily ever after—though
the Lord knows what we’re supposed to
live on. They didn’t know us, did they, old
one? I’ll say they didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Everybody roared with laughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, well,” said Nicky, “you know, they’re
the thing nowadays—unhappy endings—they
all do it—call it Realism.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“David,” said Aunt Lucy, “he’ll never marry

<p class='c005'>“Nonsense!” said Doctor David. “Donaldson’s

Beverly Carlysle hasn’t been heard of for

<p class='c005'>“I’ve asked Elizabeth Wheeler to go to the

It is most embarrassing for Elizabeth.
I think you ought to do something about it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Very well, dear. I’ll go to Wyoming and

<p class='c013'>Because he never started. He was too busy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Who was Dick Livingston? Dick did not
know. He could remember that little cabin in
the Wyoming mountains, the snow-storm, himself
recovering from an illness, in the care of
Doctor David—nothing back of that. The rest
was walled off.</p>

<p class='c005'>If he could only have a severe shock—a
breaking point—get run over by a train or
something—<em>and awake surrounded by familiar
things</em> to stir his dormant memory—perhaps——?</p>

<p class='c015'>Beverly Carlysle’s brother, Fred Gregory,
saw him in the theatre. Louis Bassett, reporter
on the <cite>Times-American</cite>, saw Gregory see him.
What did it mean?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>He hurried back to the office, got out the
files of the paper for ten years back, read them
through, advertisements and all, then read
them through again. It was four o’clock in the
morning when his eye fell on this advertisement:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Wanted—Cook. Protestant preferred, anything
taken. Apply L-22 this office.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He clipped it, put it in his note book, packed
his bag and took the midnight train for
Wyoming.</p>

<p class='c015'>Gregory hastened to Beverly Carlysle’s
dressing-room.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Counted the house?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fourteen hundred and one,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is the doctor in?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, certainly not—I mean—either of them.”</p>

Bassett gave him a drink of good new post-war
whisky and David immediately passed out.</p>

<p class='c005'>They were nearly arrested by the prohibition
agent, who had the exclusive boot-legging
privilege for Norada and surrounding territory.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Louis carried the unconscious man down
the fire-escape, stole two horses and took him
through a blinding blizzard to the well-known
mountain-cabin, one of the most frequented
points of interest in the State—rubber-neck
wagons every two hours.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IX</h3>

<p class='c013'>To the seclusion of this mountain fastness,
Bassett brought the unconscious Richard, laid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>him in a bunk (bunk! how appropriate!) surrounded
him with a Gillette razor, an Ingersoll
watch, an Arrow collar, a can of Campbell’s
soup, and a Ford car. He watched narrowly.</p>

<p class='c005'>The sleeping man awoke.</p>

<p class='c005'><em>His eyes fell upon the old familiar things.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>He started—“I remember”—stopped.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bassett cranked him again.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you remember?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I remember, I remember the house where
I was born, the little window where the sun
came peeping in at morn.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is your name?” said Louis quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My name is——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My name is Norval. On the Grampian
Hills——”</p>

<p class='c005'>He relapsed into coma.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some hooch!” exclaimed Bassett.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two days later he again awoke. “Are you
normal now? Or still Norval?” asked Bassett.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am Jud Clark,” he answered. “I shot
Beverly Carlysle’s husband in the”—he
stopped.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In what?” asked Bassett, regarding him
steadily.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“In the billiard room. He tore the cloth
with his cue. It was justifiable homicide.
There were no witnesses. I could not possibly
be convicted. We must flee at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you remember anything else?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes. I am Dick Livingston. I can remember
Papa and Mamma, Uncle David, Aunt
Lucy, the cook, Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler, the
postman and the spot on the parlor rug—everything—everyone,
except—one. I cannot
remember Elizabeth. I remember how she
looked, her voice, her eyes, her hair—but not
her name—Elizabeth—I cannot remember
that.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Bassett took Dick on his back and carried
him for days and days, miles and miles, up and
down the mountains, through the blinding blizzard,
without food, drink or sleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he deposited his burden on the station
platform at Norada, his hands and feet were
worn to ribbons.</p>

<p class='c005'>He looked cautiously around. A man approached—blue
uniform, brass buttons. They
must not be taken alive!</p>

<p class='c005'>He shouldered the conscious man again,
drew his revolver, set his back against a
door. It yielded. They fell headlong backwards——</p>

<p class='c013'>Into the waiting room. Bassett shoved the
still conscious man under a bench and met the
blue-coated officer nonchalantly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Looking for any one?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, yes.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who—whom?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, only Jud Clark. They say there’s a
reward on his head.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Just then the still conscious man rolled out
from under the bench. The officer sprang forward
and snatched the hat from his head.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nope!” he said, “not him—nothing there
but hair.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The sheriff of this county.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gosh! I am relieved! I thought you were
the prohibition officer.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again he lifted the still conscious man on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where are we going now?” asked Dick.</p>

<p class='c005'>“New York,” said Bassett.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>XII</h3>

<p class='c013'>Three days later they reached New York—by
train.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We must find Fred Gregory,” said Bassett.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought he told Uncle David he was going
to Wyoming.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“A bluff. He’ll be right out in front of the
Martinique.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But he was not. They found him in Beverly
Carlysle’s house. They entered with drawn
revolvers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hands up!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Up they went, Beverly’s and Gregory’s.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You look natural, Jud,” said Beverly, “all
dressed up with a gun.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Silence, woman!” said Bassett sternly. “I
have brought a confession for you two to sign.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“All right,” said Gregory. “Got a fountain pen?”</p>

<p class='c005'>This was the confession:</p>

<p class='c015'>“We, being of sound mind and in fear of death,
do voluntarily make, sign, seal, publish and declare
this our last confession:</p>

<p class='c005'>Dick Livingston is not Jud Clark. He is Fred
Gregory. Howard Lucas, Beverly Carlysle’s husband,
was not killed by Jud Clark. She was not
married to the man Jud Clark killed. It was
Fred Gregory.</p>

<p class='c005'>Howard Lucas did not gouge Jud Clark’s billiard
table. It was a pool table. Fred Gregory gouged
it, practicing putting.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jud Clark was not killed by Howard Lucas. It
was Fred Gregory. He was shot by Howard Lucas—or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>else Howard Clark was shot by Fred Lucas—one
or the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Beverly Carlysle saw the man shot in the billiard
room. She was in her own room when the trigger
was pulled and hurried down in time to see the fatal
bullet hit Fred Clark or Howard Gregory—whichever
it was.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fred Gregory’s real name is Fred Gregory. He
was the son of Henry Livingston on his mother’s
side. The children were twins. So was Howard
Lucas.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is something wrong somewhere. The
whole thing was a mistake.</p>

<p class='c005'>We do further confess that Dick Livingston is
not the son of Elihu Clark but of Fred Gregory—unless
he decides to claim the Clark millions—in
which case, he is.</p>

<p class='c005'>We do further confess that Fred Gregory gave the
drink to Dick Livingston in Norada. It was not
Louis Bassett, who violated the Volstead Act.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dick was back in Haverly. Aunt Lucy met
him at the door.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Elizabeth is engaged to Wallie Sayre,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who’s Elizabeth?” asked Dick.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aunt Lucy remained unconscious for three
days, but finally recovered.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>It was weeks later when the door-bell rang

something. Please excuse me. I’ve been so

<p class='c015'>Louis Bassett, in the <cite>Times Republican</cite>

    <div class='c004'><span class='sc'>Sinclair Lewis</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>It was night in Zenith, the night of the grand
testimonial banquet tendered to George F.
Babbitt, by the Boosters Club, in honor of
the publication of the well-known novel entitled
“Babbitt.” Mr. Babbitt spoke on “American
Literature,” in part as follows:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Fellow Boosters: In rising to address you on
this auspicious occasion, I want to say first and
foremost that I am glad and proud that when it
came to the turn of the City of Zenith and yours
truly to of had their old, old story told, so to
speak, it was by an up-to-date modern successful
writer, who, I am told on good authority,
sells his books by their thousands and their tens
of thousands, amounting in all, I am led to
believe, to somewhere in the neighborhood of
upward of approximately about 400,000 volumes
of a single book, an output, my friends,
which compares favorably with the production
of cans of condensed milk and pasteboard cartons
produced in our great city, and puts literature
firmly upon the basis of quantity
production of a standardized output.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“I am glad and proud, I may say, that it was
him, this modern, up-to-date literary writer,
full of pep and punch, who sees things as they
are and not as others see us, that it has fallen
to his lot to depict this book.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now, my friends, let us come with me and
cast a glance backward upon American literature
in the old days of yore, as the poet says,
and see how different it used to be, and I will
not detain you long. Let us see how different
was the lot of such writers as James J. Whittier
and Edwin A. Poe and William Wordsworth
Longfellow, when they were in their prime.
Did they sell their books by their thousands and
their tens of thousands and have a snug bank-account
and a nice little bungalow, maybe, and
a good little bus standing ready in his own
garage, so he could climb in, step on the gas
and shoot out into God’s good out-o’-doors for
a little airing and exercise after the day’s work?
No, sir, my friends, I say it without fear of
contradiction; they did not.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Literature in those bygone days of yore was
something else again, as one of our greatest
writers puts it in his well-known tales of Potash
and Perlmutter, depicting the better side of
our Hebrew friends, with all their love of home
and family. They were lucky if they sold one
of their poems or fiction-writings for a mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>song to some publisher, who maybe paid them
enough to eke out a miserable pittance in some
garret or some place like that.</p>

<p class='c005'>“And, why, my friends, was this the case?
Simply and solely because, my friends, they
didn’t write about the things that Zenith City
wants to read. What do we want to read, if I
may put the question? Why, we want to read
about the things we know about and understand—about
the things of home and business—about
business, first and foremost.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The kind of romance we want is not the
romance of two knights in tin armor trying to
punch holes in each other’s stomachs, if you will
excuse the word, with spears or something or
maybe making illicit love—I speak plainly for
we must not blink these evils—to some countess,
who was maybe already the wife of some
lord or duke, as in the bygone days of chivalry,
when knighthood was in flower, as the poet says.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That’s not the kind of romance we want.
Believe me or not, my friends, when two keen-witted
American realtors, maybe, of my own
profession, sit down to make a deal, maybe
about a piece of real estate, matching our keen
wits against each other in the struggles and
triumphs of modern business—there, my
friends, is the romance of to-day.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Us real he-American men and our wives and
kiddies want to read about our city, Zenith,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>God bless it! and our homes properly equipped
with a bathroom with sanitary plumbing,
which I say without disrespect and I challenge
any man to deny it, is the hall mark of civilization
in this twentieth century of ours, and not
like the filthy habits and customs of the effete
nations of Europe to whom the use of soap—God
save the mark!—is practically unknown.
We like to read about our autos, our hot-water
heating and kitchen cabinets and vacuum-cleaners
and those sort of things.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is facts we want and not imagination,
and I am glad to say that the successful literary
writers of to-day, with their ears to the ground,
their eyes to the keyhole and their nose to the
grindstone, are hearing the stern voice of the
people—yea! and heeding it. Imagination has
had its day, my friends. It was all very well
in those bygone days of yore for an author to
depend on his imagination, but it’s different
now.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let us contrast for a moment and I will not
detain you long, two well-known writers. Take
Washington Irwin, for instance, what did he
write about? Why it is well known of all men
that he wrote about many things that never had
actually happened in this broad land of ours
nor anywhere else. Take Rip Van Winkle, for
instance, all about a disgraceful old bum, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>soused himself into such a state that he beat his
wife—a thing, I am sure, with all due respect,
no man here in this audience would be guilty
of in public. Then he got chased by a headless
horseman—a headless horseman, mind you, my
friends, an utter impossibility—and then to
crown the climax he slept for twenty or thirty
years, a perfect absurdity and one which, I am
sure, no citizen of Zenith would place in the
hands of a growing boy as an example to
imitate.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now take another writer of the same name—zippy,
peppy, up-to-date—a man who can sell
his stuff to the <cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite>, than
which there is no higher standard in our day
and generation. Why, gentlemen, if Washington
Irwin should turn over in his grave, I say
without fear of contradiction, he would be
absolutely and teetotally unable to recognize
his own son, Will.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And, gentlemen, consider for a moment,
where this here imagination leads. If you
depend on it for your raw material, you can’t
go in and out among the people, notebook in
hand and jot down what you actually see with
your own eyes. No, sir, you got to work your
old imagination for what you write about, and
what does this lead to? Why, gentlemen, you
all know that Edwin A. Poe, for instance, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>he wanted to write about some raven or a
skeleton in armor or something had to drink
himself into a state of insensibility or worse
before he could put pen to paper. That’s what
they had to do.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Think of those debased minds like James
J. Whittier or William Wordsworth Longfellow
or George Cullen Bryant, maybe, hiding in
their wretched garrets or some place, taking
shot after shot of hop, smoking opium, maybe,
or worse, to keep their imaginations going to
supply even the feeble demand for their hand-made
output.</p>

<p class='c005'>“That was bad enough, my friends, but things
got going from bad to worse before they got
better, and who made them better? Why, you,
my friends, and me, the American business man.
It was this way. The wide-awake business man
of America began to employ the best writers,
to write his ads. These writers dealt with
facts, gentleman, facts, in their own inimical
style, if I may say so, and the advertising sections
of our great American magazines shortly
rivaled in interest the stories and other fictional
matter, so that it was the common custom of
our business men to tear out the advertising
section and keep that to read and throw the rest
away.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The editors and publishers of our great
magazines found themselves paying good money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>for stories and for good white paper to print
them on and it being torn out and thrown away,
which wasn’t good business. This, gentlemen,
was the lowest depths to which literature at last
got, the apothesis of our literature, if you will
pardon the use of a high-brow term.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then a smart, keen-witted American business
man who happened to be editor of one of
the magazines saved the situation, so to speak.
He saw that literature had got anæmic. It was
short on red blood corpuscles. It needed a
transfusion of blood.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So he put the patient face to face and
shoulder to shoulder with the real force in
American life, the advertisements—made a
page ad face a page of so-called literature—cut
the stories into strips and put a column ad
next to a column of fictional writing.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The name of this literary genius, I am creditably
informed, was Cyrus H. K. Bok, and,
believe me, the greatest surgeon of modern
times, who saved American literature from
taking the count in a fight to a finish was this
same old Doc Bok.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The result was not only that you couldn’t
tear out the stories and throw them away without
simultaneously and at the same time
destroying the thing you wanted to read, and
after you had read all the ads two or three times
you simply had to give the stories the once over.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“And, moreover and likewise, the fictitious
writers couldn’t keep on writing their imaginative
bunk and get away with it. They
couldn’t stack up some guff about a raven or a
skeleton in armor against the real thing, like
the Ginko Cigar or the Jimmy Pipe. If they
tried to pull any Rip Van Winkle stuff alongside
a smart talk about Hartenheimer’s Morestyle
Clothing, the picture of the clean-faced young
man—bright-eyed, square-jawed and everything—simply
made old Rip look like three mutilated
dimes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“So they got wise and changed their act and
begun writing the kind of real stuff about which
I’ve been talking to you about. It got to be
so good, so full of real American life and
everything, that some of it gets printed every
week on the page facing the highest priced full
page ad in the <cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite>, and
that’s the proudest position in American literature
to which any man can aspire to. It used
to be that the preferred position, as the ad-men
say, for an ad was next to reading-matter.
Now look at the columns of the greatest
American magazine with its millions of readers.
Are the ads next to reading-matter? No, sir,
not on your life. The reading-matter is next to
the ads—and that’s saying something, believe
you me.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“Now, gentlemen, let me say a few words
about the book about which we are gathered
here to-night, and I will not detain you long.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s a good book, a great book, and yet, my
friends, it has its faults, as whom of us has
not?</p>

<p class='c005'>“Friend author, for all he calls himself a
realist and pretends he don’t shy at nothing in
calling a spade a spade, don’t do it. No, sir,
he don’t. Take that chapter in this book, now,
about me getting up and getting dressed.
What’s he say there? Why he talks about ‘the
best of nationally advertised and quantitatively
produced alarm clocks.’ Now, anybody here
knows he means a Big Bob, and why not say it
right out, just like that? Why, he just as well
say ‘he removed the superfluous growth of hair
from his countenance by means of an instrument
designed for that purpose,’ when he means
’he shaved his face with a razor.’</p>

<p class='c005'>“But these realistic fictitious writers will
come to it, and just to help them I’ll tell you
how that chapter ought to be wrote.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The Big Bob alarm clock gave him a jolt
that knocked all the sleep out of him. He
drug his legs, in Matchless Pajamas, out from
under the Downiwool Blanket and sat on the
edge of the Ostermarsh Mattress, supported
by the Neversag Spring. While he paddled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>around with his feet to find his Comfy Slippers,
he looked out at his new Flimsibilt Sectional
Garage, which looked good to him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then he beat it to the good old warm bathroom,
all tiled with Shiniwhite Glazed Tiles.
The bathroom was fitted with a Staykleen Bath
Tub, a Porcellow Washstand and other sanitary
fixtures all complete, including a Nasco All-Steel
Medicine Cabinet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“He cleaned his teeth with a Rubwell toothbrush
and a squeeze of Lillidol to get the fuzzy
taste out of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then he rubbed a gob of Whiskerine on his
face to soften his beard and lathered her good
with Shavo Cream on his Bristletite Shaving
Brush. The good old Neverkeen Safety Razor
did the rest.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A D. V. undershirt and knee-length drawers
started the job of dressing, followed by a
Bronx Shirt, onto which he buttoned a Spear
Collar with a Kalisch One-Piece Collar Button.
Then he put on his Hartenheimer Suit and a
pair of Walkstrate Shoes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then he put in his pockets a Walgin Watch
with a Wearever Gold Chain, a Leakwell
Fountain Pen and a Neverpoint Pencil.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For breakfast he had a Moonshine Orange,
a plate of Mothers’ Wild Oats, a slice of Mawruss
Ham and two ordinary unadvertised eggs,
Digesto Bread, spread with Prunella Butter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>and a cup of Moko-Boko Coffee, and, when he
had lighted a good old Ginko Cigar, George F.
Babbitt was ready for the fray.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There, my friends, I don’t pretend to be a
literary gink, but you give me my good old
fountain pen and the advertising pages of the
<cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite> and I’ll show you how
to marry literature and life together. That’s
what we want, gentlemen. That’s real, true
blue United States one hundred per cent
realism.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>JOSEPH AND THE BRIGHT SHAWL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c015'>He had never before heard of Cuba, but a
chance mention of its name, Cuba, dominated
Joseph completely. The Spaniards were shooting
Cubans down there. Boys, younger than
himself. And they were shot with muskets,
guns. That was so much more horrible than
if they were shot with candlesticks or white
mice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instantly he knew that he must liberate Cuba.
He must shoot the beastly Spanish Captain-General
in his gold-laced abdomen, tummy;
himself be shot in return or elsewhere, and die
heroically, while a competent brass-band played
“Annie Laurie.” So should Cuba be free.</p>

<p class='c005'>He quickly settled every visible, every audible
detail save one, his last dying words. “Don’t
give up the ship!” seemed inappropriate. “I
owe a cock to Æsculapius; see that it is paid,”
was too long. “Kiss me, Hardy!” was short,
but heaven knew what utter stranger might
accept the invitation. At last he fixed upon
“Sic semper tyrannis!” to be said as he fired,

<p class='c005'>Providing a costume for the event was a
puzzling matter. It should be of the period, but
what was the present year of grace? It was
in the fall, exactly forty years before the return
of the Americans from the Great War in 1919.
Was this then 1879? Impossible, since Grant
was President, and Fish, Secretary of State,
and that would make it not later than 1876.</p>

<p class='c005'>He gave it up, threw chronology to the winds,
bought a plum-colored cape, vintage of the
Regency, and a lot of very high stocks, period
of Daniel Webster. Perhaps, in this he was
misled by reading in a newspaper that stocks
were very high.</p>

<p class='c005'>His armament was one small pearl-handled
derringer, date 1849. He wore it suspended by
a string inside of one leg of a trouser, a pant,
and could always verify its presence by sitting
down. It had been given him by his father
and was not really a dangerous weapon, since
it was necessary to turn down all its grease-cups
daily, else it would not go off, shoot.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the deck of the <i><span lang="es">Morro Castle</span></i>, whence all
but he had fled, stood a solitary figure, little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Joe, the Boy Liberator. The tallest of stocks
seemed to proclaim the Duke of Wellington;
the plum-coloredest of capes, Beau Brummell.
Like Napoleon, he depended greatly on his
heavy artillery, which, in turn, depended inside
a nicely-cut trouser.</p>

<p class='c005'>Andrés Escobar called on him at the Hotel
Inglaterra.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is this your first visit to Cuba?” he asked.
“What do you think of our Cuban women?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is. I do not,” laconic Joseph replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I mean I don’t think about them at all,”
he continued. “My mind has been singularly
purified. I have a sensation of remoteness
from my flesh.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah,” said Andrés, “I see. Something like
<i><span lang="es">un esqueleto</span></i>, a skeleton. Very nice for the
hot weather.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not exactly,” said Joseph doubtfully. “Still,
come to think of it, there is something in what
you say. But lissen, friend, <i><span lang="es">amigo</span></i>! I came
here to shoot, <i><span lang="es">tirar, el Capitan-General</span></i> in his
gold-laced tummy and to get shot in the fracas
or somewhere else. Thus Cuba shall be
freed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I have been here twenty-four hours. We
are both still alive and Cuba is not yet free. My
fiery nature will not brook such delays. Can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>you not lead me to <i><span lang="es">el Capitan-General</span></i>, so that
I may fulfil muh destiny?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Andrés clasped his hand. “<i><span lang="es">Maravilloso!</span></i>” he
cried. “We Cubans are not so <i><span lang="es">precipitado</span></i>.
We bide our <i><span lang="es">tiempo</span></i>. Let me tell you our
watchword, college-yell, <i><span lang="es">secretissimo</span></i>! ‘Wait,
wait for ’98!’ Ah, then, Cuba shall be <i><span lang="es">libre</span></i>.
Meanwhile we conspire, oh! so discreetly.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At Escobar’s house, the entire family sat
in a silent circle, upon gilt chairs. A crystal
chandelier cast upon them an icy flood of light,
bathed them in a vitreous fluid, preserving them
in a hard pallor <em>forever</em>—think of that! The
Escobars had been much besought by ambitious
undertakers desiring to use this really effective
embalming process.</p>

<p class='c005'>Andrés and Joseph came in. Andrés, silent,
faultless, sat down immobile. But Joseph and
Narcissa, the daughter, withdrew to the
balcony.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was night. Narcissa was decidedly fetching.
But, fetch her darnedest, she could not
fetch Joseph.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I love you,” said she.</p>

<p class='c005'>Joseph put his arm, one arm, around her
shoulders, not her waist, and kissed her cheek,
not her lips—<em>once</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lissen,” said he, “love is not for me. You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>know my name. Have you grasped its significance?
Read your bible! Moreover,” he
continued, “I am devoted to one purpose. I
must shoot <i><span lang="es">el Capitan-General</span></i> in his gold-laced—well—that
is—in his gold-laced uniform—yes.
And get shot myself in—well—that is a
detail, a mere detail. Anyhow, thus shall Cuba
be <i><span lang="es">libre</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now lissen you to me,” said Narcissa.
“I’m in trouble. I’m engaged to marry a fat
planter of fifty. I loathe him. I shall kill him
or myself. Get me out of this. Get me on a
steamer, so I can go to my aunt in New York.
Help me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, really, you know, I couldn’t,” replied
dauntless Joseph. “I might get arrested or
spanked or something—and sent home to
mother before I get properly shot. Oh! it
wouldn’t do at all.”</p>

<p class='c005'>No, it wouldn’t do. It would free only a
single Cuban, Narcissa. He must free the
whole Cuban people, <i><span lang="es">caboodle</span></i>, and perish in
the attempt.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was at the theatre, <i><span lang="es">teatro</span></i>, when he first
saw the Shawl—that orange, blue, emerald,
scarlet, magenta, vermilion, crimson atrocity.
Incidentally, there was a woman inside it, La
Clavel, the dancer. Joseph thought it was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>woman who thrilled him until he could support
it no longer—it made him so ashamed of himself!
But it wasn’t. It was the Shawl, for he
was—Joseph.</p>

<p class='c005'>He went to her room, sat there, day after
day. They talked, conversed, interminably—and
that was all. Once she kissed him and was
severely frost-bitten. He was annoyed, seriously,
and told her he didn’t know what she
would think of him for letting her do a thing
like that.</p>

<p class='c005'>She gave him messages for his friends, the
Fabians, cunctators, who conspired so sweetly
to pass the time until 1898. Joseph felt that
he was just the cutest little plotter in all Cuba.
Oh! it was grand!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>He was in her room when Santaclaus entered,
Capitan Santaclaus, one of the rudest of the
rude Spaniards.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You are conspiring against the King, <i><span lang="es">el
Rey</span></i>,” said Santaclaus. “You and your young
devotee, little Josie here. You will both be
killed. It will be very enjoyable.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The time had come! Santaclaus, while not
the <i><span lang="es">Capitan-General</span></i>, was notably well equipped
for the proper reception of the sacred bullet.
Joseph hoisted out the artillery, leveled it,
pulled the trigger. Click! Nothing more.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Joseph stared dully at the faithless weapon.
“Oh, sugar! You’re a mean old thing!” was
all he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ah! ha!” sneered Santaclaus. “You forgot
to turn down the grease-cups this morning.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was sneerly his last sneer. Although he
knew it not, he was sneering his end. La Clavel
had not yet begun to fight. When she did
there certainly was one turrible old battle.
Joseph stood bravely by, a chair raised above
his head, almost resolved to give Santaclaus a
hard knock.</p>

<p class='c005'>One round was all. Santaclaus, prostrate,
prone, defunct, dead, took the count. Joseph
carefully replaced the chair.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now look what you’ve done,” said he.
“Now, remember, <em>you</em> killed him. I didn’t do
a thing to him. Don’t tell on me—please!
I came down here to get killed, nice and clean,
with <em>one</em> bullet. I certainly don’t want to get
all mussed up by a firing-squad. Mother
wouldn’t like me to.”</p>

<p class='c005'>La Clavel was arrested—tortured, shot, hung,
drawn and quartered, for all Joseph knew.
But she sent him the Shawl. So it was his lucky
day, after all.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Pilar de Lima was a lovely little Chink.
She tried it on with Joseph, but Joseph continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>to be—Joseph. Andrés took her up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lend me the Shawl, <i><span lang="es">viejo cimo</span></i>, old top!”
said he. “Pilar wants it to wear at the <i><span lang="es">danzon</span></i>,
dance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” Joseph responded, answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<i><span lang="es">Mio caro compañero</span></i>, my dear fellow,” protested
Andrés, “please remember that The
Bright Shawl is the principal character in this
piece, the title rôle. It must have stage-center
and the spotlight all the time. The whole show
is built around it. And <em>this</em> is to be the climax
of the third act.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“True,” said Joseph, “true. If it wasn’t for
The Bright Shawl, where would all of us be?—Still
in the inkwell.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>⁂</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Pilar wore it at the <i><span lang="es">danzon</span></i> in the <i><span lang="es">teatro</span></i>.
Joseph sat in a box and Arco de Vaca told him
that Andrés was about to be killed. He loved
Andrés with his whole soul, such as it was, so
he watched the last scene with interest from a
safe place. To free Cuba and be shot while
the band played was one thing. To mix up in
the murder of his best friend and maybe get
arrested—that was something else again.</p>

<p class='c005'>But his iron nerve failed him. He took his
hat and fled blindly—right into the midst of
the fracas, where Pilar was stabbing Andrés and
ink flowed like blood. Some kind friend batted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Joseph over the head and he passed out.
Curtain.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<p class='c005'>That was about all—except that the
S. P. C. C. shipped the little dare-devil back to
his mother, unpunctured.</p>

<p class='c015'>He thought the matter over for forty years
and was finally inclined to the belief that the
blow on his head....</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, maybe it did and maybe it didn’t.
Who can tell?</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p class='c013'>“Tea?” asked Marion.</p>

<p class='c005'>Through the long casement window, which
lazily unfolded its unaustere yet deliberate
length in a benediction of sunlight, not more
interminable than the crepitant genuflection of
the waveless ocean, came the tall dark cry of
the curlew, as it lashed its angry though querulous
tail in intermittent certitude. Perhaps
that was why the shiny, untarnished mud flats,
blue veined with the tortuous eternal channels
of the running tides, interspersed with the
nostalgic counterparts of antiquity, and the
gray green marshes, where the red shanks
choired in uninterrupted but not unvexed prolixity,
despite their propinquity, had always
seemed to her as remote from the perpetual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>imbroglio with spiritual things that makes man
the most ridiculous of animals, though just
emerged from a brave dive in some pool of
vitality, whose whereabouts are the secret that
makes the mouth vigilant.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, please,” answered Ellen, smiling.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps that was why the chair, on which
she sat, so dully gleaming in its polished adroitness
that not even in her childhood, when the
saffron-tinted memories of yesterday were mellowed
in glorious achievement, could she withstand
the monotonous testimony of its faultlessness,
seemed now to her to concentrate and
reveal what either simple necessity or pain-flawed
consanguinity had crowded back into
the stuffed closets of perpetual oblivion, darkling
upon the wimpled surface of an efflorescent
yet intangible conviction. She could not but
recall to mind another night, more than thirty
years before, when she stood in the barnyard
where it was brown and oozy underfoot and
there was nothing neat about it all, yet the
mellow cry of well-fed cattle lambently surged
through the windows of the tumbledown sheds,
with their thatched eaves like thick brows over
eyes ever gazing at the strange fluctuations
of the wine-like light, as if they were consciously
preserving the cattle from the magic
of any enchantment, and the round red moon
hung on the breast of a flawless night, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>feet were hidden in an amethystine haze, and
held in her arms two little Berkshire pigs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sugar?”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was because of this sterility of outlook that
Richard’s father’s tomb, standing whitely in its
futile magnificence, abruptly, almost innately,
yet clandestinely intricate in its classic contour,
could never have called to her with the high
ecstatic voice with which the Pentlands, so remote,
but not untutored nor conflicting with the
harmonious interposition of all that was sagely
beneficial, challenged Ellen. No one, not even
he, had ever engendered a skepticism of the
value of all activities, rose-tinted but not blue,
shining vaguely like a great cloud galleon, whose
shrill cry drilled a tiny hole in the ensphering
silence. Richard had never done that.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Two lumps, please,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her voice trailed away from her mouth in a
long ambiguous spiral of malachite-green silk,
shot through with golden gleams like porphyry,
so that the other, knowing nothing of its source
could not have supposed that, with the conscious
artistry of the unprecedented, yet not unembarrassed
by all the implications of a too great
inattention, there could be other than the most
delicate intimation of flattery in its rich effulgency,
tempered by the knowledge of interminable
philanthropy, that so often masquerades
as the unseen offspring of a nature, noble in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>essential attributes, yet not unhampered by the
apparent inelasticity of its unchangeable,
though not immutable, because finely tempered,
intimations of immortality. Never had there
been any doubt of this.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lemon?”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was not so easy to forgive Aunt Alphonsine,
for her voice had been as sharp as the
shears click-clacking with never-ceasing vigilance
through the exiguous fleeces of the lanate
lambs now, in alliterative honesty, so palely, so
profitably become shorn sheep, and yet not
angry, though with an acerbating asperity evident
in every tone of its fluctuating timbre,
running indefatigably up the switch-backs and
circling in the merry-go-rounds, capriciously
perambulating on which the voices of French-women,
from the lucent symbolism of the errant
wife of Charles Martel, bathed in the ineffable
luxury of mediæval intricacy, to the misguided,
yet pitiable, complacency of a Parisian midinette,
travel eternally, since that French
thrift, which made her clean her shoes at home
and thereby maim herself into something new
and strange, seared by the hot vapors of the
exploding benzine, that desired to assassinate
love, sacred and profane, whenever she saw it,
made her terribly exercised at the potency of
starvation to dull the edge of appetite into the
semblance of inarticulate inevitability, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>crucifixion of honest hunger. Richard himself
was aware of that.</p>

<p class='c005'>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In all of this there had been nothing to distract
her attention, which so often divagated
intermittently, as with the pulsing beat of the
tides, now lapsing into desuetude, in the purple-bathed
intricacies of interminable monotony,
from a candid valuation of the dress of the
other so blue, so deeply blue, that, from depths
unsounded, whence ghostly memories of her
childhood emerging, appeared and beat upon
her nether eyelids, there was now extruded none
of those waves of intelligent vacuity, whose
infrequency alone gave her pleasant physical
sensations as of creeping gooseflesh at the roots
of her hair and the desire to erase from the
pages of her memory the pictures of the Christmas
number of the <em>Graphic</em>, though all their
colors seemed to refuse to travel from her eyes
to her nerves and back again, as with rhythmic
diastole, pendulously they swung in their
predestined arc, such as she usually experienced
when the turbid instancy of old rose impinged
in somnolent ecstasy upon the complicated
convolutions of her brain. Richard was right
after all.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>I</h3>

<p class='c013'>I awoke very sore from the gruelling adventures
of the previous day. Being more hungry
than was my wont, I quickly despatched the
hunch of crusty bread and bit of cheese, which
the highwayman had left me, and fared forth
upon my journeying. My way lay adown a
leafy lane, lined with hedgerows, gemmed with
myriad sparkling dew drops, wherein birds sang
a jubilant pæan. So faring forth, I crossed a
small rustic bridge spanning a murmurous
brook and so into a dense wood, whose twisted,
writhen branches and myriad leaves made a
dim twilight, wherein a wind dank and chill
moaned fitfully, very dismal to hear.</p>

<p class='c005'>I sought to flee these gloomy shades, but
tripped and fell headlong into a leafy glade,
where sat a small, fierce, quick, keen-eyed
tinker a-tinkering.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh!” said I, “pray pardon my intrusion.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Old ’ard!” quoth he in mighty voice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“that’s a good word. I’m a poet myself. Wot

<p class='c005'>“Oh!” cried I, “you say that is original?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aye, it is,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Strange how much you resemble your
father,” quoth I, and left him.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>II</h3>

<p class='c013'>I had scarce advanced an hundred paces ere
I espied a murmurous brook and at the same
time was aware of snapping of twigs and sounds
of one, who burst through all obstacles in desperate
flight. I gazed wildly about and espied
a gypsy girl, who came bounding adown the
steep. At sight of me she checked and stood
at gaze.</p>

<p class='c005'>There she stood, a young dryad of the woods,
gray eyes adream, passionate with life yet
boldly virginal.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“Who the hell are you?” she murmured
softly. Then she seized me by the hand.
“Come, let’s run,” she quoth; “they’re after
me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,” I gasped, “who?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shadrach, Meschech and Abednego,” she
stated briefly, “The Rommany Three. Count
them!” and so saying, she fled, I perforce following.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ensued wild scramble through dismal wood,
where mournful wind stirred, trees dankly
dripped, wet leaves brushed faces, rain-sodden
underbrush clung about wearied limbs. Came
we at last out upon a broad highway, between
grassy banks, topped by hedgerows and trees,
whose wide-flung rustling leafage cast a pleasant
shade, while, high in air, a lark caroled,
faint and sweet against the blue.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III</h3>

<p class='c013'>Then looked I again upon my companion so
vivid with life, so boldly virginal, and, catching
my breath, which had hitherto eluded me,</p>

<p class='c005'>“Some runner!” I quoth. “Haven’t I met
you somewhere before?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I dessay,” she lightly answered. “You see,
George Borrow was my father and I played
<em>Isopel Berners</em> to his <em>Lavengro</em>. You’ll meet
a lot of those old troupers before you’re through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>this book. There’s the Tinker now, and old
Mrs. Herne. She plays <em>Azor</em> in this piece.
Oh! them was the days!” she sighed, “when
we was playin’ in the legit, before we come
down to this movie stuff.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,” quoth I, “then I suppose I ought to
teach you grammar. It seems to me——”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Cut it out!” she responded wearily. “Don’t!
<em>Lavengro</em> done that once and for all. You can’t
improve on him.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IV</h3>

<p class='c013'>After a space were we ware of a wayside inn,
the yard whereof was a-throng with gigs, carts,
currycombs and other vehicles. One was a
handsome closed traveling carriage, with blood
horses stamping impatient hoofs and tossing
proud heads. Standing by it was a man, tall,
slim, superlatively dark, clad in garments of
quiet elegance. His handsome pale face was
paler by contrast with locks of raven hue.
When we drew anear, he espied Diana.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, my goddess, let us fly,” said he, and,
seizing her by the waist, half lifted, half tossed
her into the carriage, leapt lightly after. In
an instant the carriage, rocking and reeling
with its swift motion, disappeared in a cloud of
dust. Dazed, I looked about me, but Diana was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>V</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Not a moment was to be lost. Seizing the
nearest horse, a jet black creature with blood-red
nostrils, I leapt lightly into the saddle and
was after them. Hedges, gemmed with dewdrops,
trees, with wide-flung leafage, spun by as
my gallant steed fell into his racing stride.
Onward we flew, mile after mile, horse after
carriage, me after her. Ever I gained upon the
pursued. At last drew level with whiffle-trees,
stooped over, with one stroke of knife cut the
traces. I was at the door of the carriage as it
lurched to a full stop.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, Diana,” I said, “this is no place for
you. I do not think this is a very nice man.
And as for you, sir, I shall spare you now because,
methinks, you will get yours in the last
chapter but one.” With that we left him.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VI</h3>

<p class='c013'>And now our way lay adown a leafy lane
lined with grassy banks, topped by hedgerows
and trees, whose wide-flung rustling leafage
cast a pleasant shade, while, high in air, a lark
caroled faint and sweet against the blue.
Crossing by a rustic bridge, a murmurous
brook, I was ware of a rough-clad, villainous-looking
man, who stood opposed to us, powerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>legs apart, hairy fist grasping a short heavy
stick or bludgeon, as the case may be. Evil
face outthrust, he leered upon Diana’s loveliness.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,” said I, “what do you want?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not you!” he snarled and, snarling, leapt at
me. With his bludgeon he struck full force a
crashing blow upon my hat. Staggering back,
I reeled for a moment’s space, but as he made
to smite again, I leapt lightly aside. “Strike
one!” I cried, the joy of battle welling within
me. Then my right flashed and smote him full
on his bristly chin. His great body shrank
horribly upon itself, rolled a limp and twisted
lump upon the ground and lay still. I turned
to look for Diana, but she was nowhere to be
seen.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VII</h3>

<p class='c013'>So I went my way, sorrowing for my lost love
adown leafy lanes lined with hedgerows,
gemmed with myriad sparkling dew drops,
wherein birds sang a jubilant pæan, till I came
to a broad highway lined with grassy banks,
topped by trees, whose wide-flung rustling
leafage cast a pleasant shade, while, high in air,
a lark caroled faint and sweet against the blue.
Full many a weary mile I trod before I was
ware of strange sounds from a dingle hard by.
Crashing into the dingle, I came at last to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>behold Diana struggling in the arms of a man
and him none other than he from which I had
so lately rescued her. Then, as I stood at gaze,
ere yet I leapt lightly to her succor, a hand
gripped me.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VIII</h3>

<p class='c013'>I turned and saw a little man, his slender
figure erect, one hand in the bosom of his
coat.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Devereux!” he called, with a terrible loud
voice.</p>

<p class='c005'>The villain started, loosed Diana and turned
upon the speaker of the evening.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Meaning me, withal?” he sneered; “that’s
not my name.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Quite unimportant,” said the little man.
“Devereux, Haredale, Marmaduke, Chester,
Steerforth—name’s unimportant. I’ve met you
a hundred times in a hundred books and plays
and whatever the name, you’re always the
same.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The stranger’s lips curled from gnashing
teeth, as he seized his heavy riding whip. A
blinding flash, a deafening report, the oncoming
figure stopped, right arm dangling helplessly,
then lurched and stumbled out of sight, as the
little man restored his little silver-mounted
pocket-pistol to his pocket.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My child,” said he, “yonder comes my man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>with the tea equipage. He always comes when
he hears me shoot any one. Let us have tea.
I am the Earl of Wyvelstoke.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So we had tea but lingered not long, as yet
there was much to be done ere the rising of the
orbed moon gave us surcease of action.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IX</h3>

<p class='c013'>And so we fared forth many a weary mile
along the broad highway, lined with grassy
banks, topped by——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Hist!” remarked Diana.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,” said I, “my dear! You must not interrupt
my description of the scenery. Pray, why
hist?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Shadrach, Meschech and Abednego!” she
averred, pointing to where three evil faces
peered through three gaps in the hedgerow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Ensued a scrambling rush of three dark figures,
with upraised heavy sticks or bludgeons.
One, snarling as was his wont, strode me-wards.
I leapt lightly aside only to meet both the other
weapons, which simultaneously descended upon
my head. Instant blackness overwhelmed me,
interspersed, however, with luminaries of dazzling
hue. When I recovered consciousness,
Diana was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>X</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>So I went my way, sorrowing for my lost love.
It was growing dusk when I reached a ruined
and desolate barn. A solitary place and dismal,
remote from the world, a very sinister place forsooth,
such indeed as might be the haunt of
grisly specters and angry moo-cows. Breath
in check, with eyes of horror stared I at that
dreadful barn, whence emanated the sound of
hollow knocks. Instantly I was transformed
into a cool, dispassionate, relentless creature,
intent upon one desperate purpose, though as
yet I wot not what that purpose was.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Be damned to ye, Shadrach!” panted a
hoarse voice. “’Eave, man! ’Eave! Her’s a
sittin’ on th’ trap door.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I crept toward the ladder whereon they stood,
leapt and smote with all my might. Ensued a
battle grim and great. Ensued thereupon a
silence, an emptiness, a stillness and from afar
I heard lugubrious voices growing fainter and
fainter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh,” cried I, “Diana! Ah there, Diana!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, what’s wanted?” queried she.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Will you marry me, Diana?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t be foolish, kid. You’ve mixed your
cues. That line belongs in the last chapter.
You’d better go to bed now. You’ve had a
busy day.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>So, knowing that the morrow would bring
further adventure, I lay down and fell into a
dreamless sleep, but when I awoke in the morning,
Diana was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class='c013'>Claude Wheeler opened his eyes, just as he
had done often before. The dreary monotony
of his day thus monotonously began. He
turned on one elbow and gazed at his shirt
hanging on the chair beside his bed. It was the
same shirt which he had worn yesterday, would
wear to-morrow. But it was not the monotony
of the shirt that deluged him with self-pity. It
was the fact that he had only one collar-button.
Other people, the Erlich boys in Lincoln, his
own father, had two. Claude had but one,
which fastened his shirt in front. When he
wore a collar he had to fasten it at the back
with an old piece of string, which Mahailey had
given him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Claude would have liked to buy another
collar-button. He had more than enough
money; and his father was a rich farmer. He
tried to excuse his cowardice to himself, but
in his heart he knew that it was too difficult for
him to do this simple thing.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>He arose wearily and dressed. He crept
down a flight of stairs to the second floor, thence
he descended to the first floor by a rude ladder.
There had been a staircase where the ladder
stood but, in an access of humility, Claude had
slid down the banisters two weeks before.
Mistaking his self-effacement for hilarity, his
father, laughing heartily, had removed the stairs
with an ax. Nat Wheeler was a large easygoing
affable man with a strong sense of humor.</p>

<p class='c005'>It made little difference with the habits of
the household. The men used the ladder freely.
Mahailey slept in the cellar on a hanging shelf,
which Claude had built for her, so that the rats
could not get at her. She used to put herself
to sleep by swinging the shelf to and fro, while
she sang “And they laid Jesse James in his
grave.” It was one of her quaint customs, a
survival of her early arboreal life in Virginia.
It added much to the gloom which overspread
the household.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Wheeler suspected that this removal of
the stairs was a joke. She had learned that
her husband’s humor might wear any guise.
But she was old fashioned. She thought it improper
either to descend or ascend a ladder, if
there were any men below, and as the men
always arose before she did and stayed up after
her bed-time, she was practically confined to
the second floor.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Claude could hear her now, walking up and
down the passage above. He could hear her
wandering, uncertain footsteps. He knew that
she had both hands pressed tightly to her breast,
that she was lost in religious meditation. He
feared that, in her absence of mind, she might
descend by the ladder and then be unable to
overcome her scruples against ascending.
There would be no place for her to sleep, except
with Mahailey in the cellar. He had not made
the shelf wide enough for two. His mother
might die for want of sleep. He felt bitterly
about that. He heard her voice calling him.
She was blinking down at him over the
banisters.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is circus day, Claude, and I’m so worried
about your collar-button. I have a piece of an
old can-opener here. Do you think you could
make that do?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t bother about it, mother. I’ll use a
shingle nail.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!” she said softly
and resumed her wanderings.</p>

<p class='c005'>He went out into the kitchen to wash. Other
people had used the bathroom before him and
he was very exclusive. In Mahailey’s old
broken mirror, he looked at himself. He was
a handsome boy with a red face, pink eyebrows
and a square head upon which his red hair stood
up like a cock’s comb. He hated his head, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>because he always had to wear a soft hat.
A stiff derby abraded the sharp corners.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mahailey came with a low, padding step, her
apron thrown over her face, as usual. She
always wore it this way. In the Wheeler family,
no one but Claude had ever seen her face.
Sometimes she shyly removed her apron, when
no one was about, and gave him one look. It
was enough. Claude knew why she kept the
apron over it.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Claude saw her coming, he ran out
of doors, down the hillside toward the barn.
Molly, the faithful old three-legged cow, was
mournfully chewing her cud. She had lost her
other leg in the Civil War. He put his arms
around her neck and kissed her. She stopped
chewing and kissed him in return. He remained
there a long time and thought about the life of
a farmer.</p>

<p class='c005'>A farmer raised good corn and wheat and
sold them. In return he got clothes that wore
out in two or three years, a house that would
not stand more than a century, an automobile
good for less than fifty thousand miles, furniture
that broke down in two generations, food
that lasted hardly a day.</p>

<p class='c005'>The life of a farmer was useless, vain, empty,
unsatisfying, monotonous, depressing, dreary.
He was a farmer and he had but one collar-button.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>A terrible joy clutched at the boy’s heart.
He knew that he was playing the part to perfection.
If he could keep it up through four hundred
and fifty-nine pages the book would be a
success. <cite>The Young Hamlet of the Prairies</cite>
would make a hit.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<p class='c013'>Claude and his men, B Company, were holding
the Boar’s Head trench. He knew that
the German attack might be expected about
dawn. The smoke and darkness had begun to
take on the livid color that announced the coming
of daybreak, when a corporal hurried to
him, saluted and announced that the linemen
had completed the connection and that Claude
was called on the telephone.</p>

<p class='c005'>He went to the dug-out, took down the receiver.</p>

<p class='c015'>Claude was very busy for the next fifteen
minutes. Just as he again took his position
on the firing-step, the Hun advance began.</p>

<p class='c005'>There they were, coming on the run. His
men were on their feet again. The rifles began
firing. Then something extraordinary happened.
There was their commanding officer on
the parapet, outlined against the Eastern sky!
Stiffly erect he stood, one arm upraised, facing
the oncoming foe. They heard his voice,
“Steady, men! Steady! It’s up to you!”</p>

<p class='c005'>They were amazed, astounded, but they responded.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>A withering fire swept the Hun lines,
men were stumbling and falling. Then the solitary
figure on the parapet was discovered by
the enemy. A bullet rattled on the tin hat, one
struck it in the shoulder. It swayed, lost its
balance, plunged, face down, outside the parapet.
Hicks caught a projecting foot, pulled—and
it came off in his hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same moment the Missourians ran
yelling up the communication trench, threw
their machine-guns up on the sand-bags and
went into action.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hicks stood petrified, staring at the foot in
his hand, when Claude, clad in his Jaegers only,
appeared, reached out and dragged the limp
figure in by both legs.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Here, Sergeant, help me with this to the
dug-out, so I can get my clothes on before it
gets too public.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My God, Lieutenant, I thought you was
killed. What’s this for? To fool the Heinies?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No—that was for the home-folks that read
serious novels.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Anthony Blaine’s grandfather had all the
money in the known world and lived in Tarrytown—a
remarkable coincidence. Entirely surrounded
by cold cash, he had acquired an
austere frigidity of manner and was commonly
called “Old Chill Blaine.” This relationship
made Anthony constantly conscious of social
security, since an aristocracy founded sheerly
on money postulates wealth in the particular—whatever
that means.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>His father, an ineffectual æsthete of that prehistoric
period known as the Nineties, had died
before he was born, apparently thus reversing
the customarily usual process of nature—a
phenomenon explicable only on the hypothesis
that language sometimes obscures the thought
it is supposed to elucidate. The fact is that
Anthony was a posthumorous child—a kind of
practical joke on his surprised mother.</p>

<p class='c005'>Anthony inherited from his father nothing
but his last name, his taper fingers and a million
dollars—a miserable heritage.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Mother Dear</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>But his mother, Beatrice Blaine! She was a
woman!—by curious chance. Born in Boston
of the old Puritan family of O’Hara, she was
educated in Rome—also in Watertown and
Ogdensburg, having been fired from three
schools successively. She went abroad and was
polished in Poland and finished in Finland.</p>

<p class='c005'>She learned to smoke Camels in the Desert
of Sahara and, at the Hague, to drink the national
beverage, double strength. All in all, she
absorbed a sort of education and an amount of
liquor that it will be impossible ever again to
find in this country.</p>

<p class='c005'>In an absent-minded moment, she married
Stephen Blaine, because she was a little bit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>weary, a little bit sad and more than a little bit
pie-eyed. He tried to keep step with her, but
in less than a year cheerfully died. So Anthony
was born fatherless.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Little Child, Who Made You?</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>His childhood and youth were spent in the
midst of privations—private cars, private
yachts and private tutors.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the age of seven he bit bell-boys, at eight
smoked cigarettes, at nine played poker, at ten
read Rabelais, at eleven imbibed intoxicants, at
twelve kissed chorus-girls, and at thirteen his
mother died of delirium tremens. He was sent
to school at St. Ritz’s.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Tom Brown at Rugby</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>St. Ritz’s isn’t Eton but it is pretty strong on
drinkin’. Anthony’s private stock was recruited
from all parts of the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s ’is pink stuff, Anthony?” asked a
fellow dipsomaniac of the fourth form, in the
intimacy of intoxication.</p>

<p class='c005'>“’At’s ole genevieve from Geneva. ‘At
green’s grenadine from Grenada, an’ ‘at yellow’s
yataghan from Yap. Make a fairish cocktail,
if you lace it with l’il ole wood-alcohol.
Keeps a fella fit, ’is stuff does.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He drank liquors of incomparable strength
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and iridescent beauty, in whose mysterious
depths all the lost lures of Mont Marter and of
42nd and Broadway shivered and shimmied
languorously in resplendent redundancy. Also
he took a shot of hop now and then.</p>

<p class='c005'>He read enormously. In his first term he
accomplished Rousseau’s Confessions, “The
Newgate Calendar,” Boswell’s Life of Johnston,
“Frank in the Mountains,” Kant’s
Critique, The Arabian Nights in fourteen volumes,
“Ten Nights in a Bar-room,” “The Dutch
Twins,” the Memoirs of Cazanova, Petronius,
Suetonius, Vitruvius, Vesuvius, Plato, Cato,
Keats, Yeats and all the Elsie books.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Incident of the Impudent Headmaster</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Clad in an opalescent dressing-gown, the color
of peacock’s eyes and emu’s fins, Anthony was
lying on a luxurious lounge of mauve satin
stuffed with eiderdown and aigrettes, reading
Ghunga Dhin and drinking Ghordon Ghin. A
timid knock on the door preceded the entrance
of the headmaster. He stood in the doorway
sheepishly, hat in hand, pulling an obsequious
forelock.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Blaine—er—er—Mister Blaine,” he said.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Margotson? What is it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I called—er—to ask you, sir, if—er—er—you
wouldn’t kindly attend a recitation—er—now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>and then—er—just as a matter of form,
you know?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go to hell!” said Anthony coldly, turning
again to his liquor.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, sir. Very good, sir.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The headmaster faded through the doorway
and, doubtless, went as he had been directed.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Damn his impudence!” muttered Anthony.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Incidental Diversions</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>He was leading man in all the school plays,
editor of the <cite>St. Ritz Bartenders’ Guide</cite>, quarterback
on the eleven, first base on the nine,
second bass on the glee club, forward on the
hockey team and backward in his studies. He
carried off first honors in the hundred-yards,
the mile, the hurdles, the hammer-throw, the
standing long drink, the debating society and
the bacchanalian orgies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus Anthony at eighteen, six feet tall and
narrow in proportion, green eyes that shone
through a tangled mass of tawny eyelashes,
scornful of the bourgeoisie and of the proletariat,
entered Princeton.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Spires and Gurgles</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>From the first he loved Princeton, the pleasantest
country club in America. He loved the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>tall, towering tapestries of trees, infinitely
transient, transiently infinite, yearning infinitely
with infinite melancholy—the dreamy double
chocolate jiggers pleasing the palate, drenching
the innards with a joy akin to pleasure—the
early moon, mistily mysterious, more mysterious
than mystery itself—the deep insidious
devotion of the dreaming peaks, in their lofty
aspiration toward the empyrean—through it all
the melancholy voices, singing “Old Nassau,”
blent in a pæan of pain. While over all the two
great dreaming towers towered toward the sky,
like a gigantic pair of white flannel trousers,
reversed.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Collars and Ties</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Anthony Blaine paused in the process of adjusting
the universe to himself and looked
about him—an apartment in a house of murky
material, windows that loomed gloomily down
upon Fifty-second Street, voluminous chairs,
a fireplace of murky black, a flamboyant
exotic rug of crimson velvet, an orange-colored
lamp—everything suggested the solidarity of
wealth, an entré into the best society.</p>

<p class='c005'>He yawned and sauntered to his bathroom,
an enormous room, where he spent most of his
time. He usually took five baths a day; on
Sundays, seven.</p>

<p class='c005'>Emerging from his bath, he polished himself
with fine sandpaper, finishing with chamois-skin,
until his smooth skin shone like satin.
From the closets bursting with clothes—underwear
for an army, silk shirts for a city, collars
and ties for a multitude—he selected his attire.</p>

<p class='c005'>He taxied to Brooks’s, to buy him some ties
and collars, then to the grill-room of the
Jazza.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was dazzling—alight; it was agony to

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“Where are you from?” inquired Anthony.</p>

brutish sensibility in him was reminded by
those thin, tinny beats that the petals were falling
from the flowered afternoon, Anthony pulled
her to him and held her helpless without breath,
with scarcely room to masticate the gum drops,
in a kiss like a chloroformed sponge.</p>

child again playing with his stamp-albums—when
Gloria and Dick came in.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Anthony!” she cried, “your grandfather has
died and left you a hundred million bucks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go ’way,” he answered with petulant gentleness,
“I’ve got a five-pistache stamp of Jugo-Rumania
and there isn’t any place for it in the

<p class='c005'>“Jugo-Rumania!” gasped Dick. “Ain’t that
the truth? The poor gink’s got ’em. He always
was a wet one.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never mind,” said glorious Gloria gently.
“I’ll marry him and take him to Arabia where

Why has the Squire never invited us to dinner?
Why is informal tea at the vicarage the summit
of our social attainment? Tell me, mother,
tell me!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Had Mrs. Gale lived the normal life of
women—not only speaking, but being spoken
to—she might have gone to her grave with her
secret unrevealed. But infinite sorrow had
weakened her and, in this, the last poignant
intimacy of her deathbed, she disclosed it to
her daughter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“My dear,” she said, “I am a Bagshawe—with
the final e—of that proud old Anglo-Indian
family. My father was Bagshawe of
the Indian Guides—not to be confounded with
Bradshaw of the Railway Guides. <em>Your</em> father,
my dear, was an excellent man in his way, whom
I loved as fondly as was consistent with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>difference in our positions. But they <em>were</em>
different, dearest Olivia. As Mrs. Bagshawe—with

course. As Mrs. Gale, only with trades-people,
linen-drapers and haberdashers, tallow-chandlers

<p class='c005'>That was the skeleton in the cupboard.
Stephen Gale had been a fine chap, but as
someone—whose modest anonymity shall be

<p class='c013'>After her mother’s death, Olivia rented the
dear old place, the home of her ancestors for
nearly twenty-five years, filled with the priceless
possessions purchased from the proceeds of
the preposterously profitable porcine proclivities
of her papa, but haunted by the family
ghosts of Berkshire and Chester White. She
fled to London to escape her heritage of shame.</p>

<p class='c005'>There she met Alexis Triona, the famous
author of <cite>Rushing Through Russia</cite>. With
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>his clean-shaven face, broad forehead, gray
eyes, humorous mouth, he looked the hero that
he wasn’t. He had faked his book from a stolen
diary which he always carried about with him
so that, at the proper moment, he might be
found out.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was a chauffeur, the son of a laborer,
therefore his diction was faultless. “Diction”
is the word. He employed it in ordinary conversation
unsparingly—diction and contradiction—for
he was a wonderful liar. Lacking
all the advantages of birth and education, he
had, nevertheless, achieved a mendacity of
majestic grandeur and ravishing art.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III</h3>

<p class='c013'>It was not until after their marriage that
Olivia discovered Triona’s essential greatness—and
his essential and fatal defect.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had taken two drinks of whisky and lay
in a drunken slumber. Olivia found on the
floor beside him the original notes of the stolen
story, preserved for this dénouement. For the
first time, she knew him for what he was—no
mere recorder of his own experiences and observations,
no mere note-book-and-camera
author, but an imaginative artist of the first
rank.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was almost stunned by the greatness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>her discovery, the realization that he, her husband,
was worthy to be placed on a pedestal
beside the greatest writers of fictitious travels—Homer,
Dante, Milton, Munchausen, Dr.
Cook.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then she made the second, the fatal discovery—that
his real name was—<em>John Briggs</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IV</h3>

<p class='c013'>The ugly monosyllables struck her like a
blow between the eyes. Alexis Triona!—John
Briggs! <em>Briggs!</em> How had she labored, erecting
her scaling ladders against the wall of exclusion,
to enter the fortified city of the upper-classes,
the county families! With what daring had she
climbed the heights, bearing the banner with a
strange device, “Triona”! And now—flat on
her back outside the pale, she lay—her <i><span lang="fr">cartes
de visite</span></i> scattered confusedly on the ground,
each inscribed “Mrs. John Briggs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The sound of the word, its assonance, its
consonance, its dissonance, rang in her ears.
What had she fled from? The supreme horror
crashed in upon her consciousness. <em>Briggs!—pigs!</em>
Now forever inescapable, her tragic heritage!
No one would ever forget it—no one
would ever try to forget it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mrs. John Briggs’s father sold pigs!” She
could hear the war cry of the aristocracy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“Briggs—Briggs—pigs, pigs, pigs,” the
drumbeat of her conquering enemies.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, pigs is pigs and Briggs is Briggs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And never the twain we’ll meet”——</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>the chant of embattled dowagers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One little pig went to market—so two little
Briggs stay home!” the warning, the command
of the elect, the desired.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was impossible. It was unthinkable. It
was unendurable. All night she sat and kept a
ghastly vigil, to confront him in his first awakening
with proofs of his Briggishness.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>V</h3>

<p class='c013'>Alexis took a ticket for Poland, fleeing the
fury of a woman Briggsed. But at Victoria station,
his talent for invention revived. He would
pretend to be a traffic policeman. Up went
his arms, semaphoring the traffic. A cold, incredulous
motor lorry refused to believe him.
He awoke in a hospital.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VI</h3>

<p class='c013'>Olivia returned to her old home. Blaise
Olifant, her tenant there, welcomed her, properly
chaperoned by his sister, gave her a home.
He was a one-armed man with a long, long nose.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>He had loved Olivia long. He longed for
Olivia’s love. But he was a model of honorable
circumspection, and for some time nothing
happened to disturb the platonic calm of their
relations.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the passion of Blaise Olifant suddenly
flamed forth. (One is careful in the choice of
a verb to describe the conflagration.) He
flung his arms about her and kissed her passionately.
She half-surrendered. She tried to
respond to his kiss—but couldn’t. <em>His long,
long nose intervened.</em></p>

<p class='c005'>How he managed to kiss her, she never knew.
But there it was. His long, long nose. Impossible
to love a man like that. Taper fingers,
yes! Tapir nose, no. Olifant!—Elephant!—could
he be? But, whether he was or not, she
could not kiss him, try as she might. The
obstacle was insurmountable, inevitable. So
she gave it up and decided to be true to
Alexis.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VII</h3>

<p class='c013'>Myra Stebbings, Olivia’s maid, was, as her
name implies, long, lean, angular and withered—had
been so from the beginning of time.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had been married but before the honeymoon
was over she found her husband wasn’t
in his right mind. His mother exonerated
Myra, saying:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“’Tain’t your fault. I knowed he was crazy
when he said he were goin’ to marry you.”</p>

<p class='c005'>One day a woman called at the hospital to see
John Briggs. They brought him the name:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Miss Myra Stebbings.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, my God!” said he, and fainted.</p>

<p class='c005'>Myra <em>had</em> that effect upon sensitive natures.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VIII</h3>

<p class='c013'>When he had recovered from the effects of
the motor lorry’s skepticism, and Myra’s visit,
he got a job as chauffeur. Therefore he met his
wife, walking along the road. So he ran right
off a precipice. It was the only thing to do to
keep up the interest.</p>

<p class='c005'>But he could not escape her. She came down
the precipice after him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What are you doing in that absurd livery?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Chauffeuring.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He told her the simple truth. The shock
was too great. She left him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go to blazes!” he called after her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Blaise’s? It’s not,” she answered. “It’s
my own home. I only rented it to him.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IX</h3>

<p class='c013'>But she thought it all over later. She was
Mrs. Alexis Triona, spoken to, invited to many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>of the homes of the gentry. Here was John
Briggs, her husband, a chauffeur, likely to be
arrested at any time for trespassing on private
precipices. Then the truth might come out!
What would the county families say to that?
Something must be done.</p>

<p class='c005'>She went out into the sweet-scented June
night, to the highly perfumed garage, where he
slept.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>X</h3>

<p class='c013'>“Alexis!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Name of John Briggs,” he answered candidly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Never again!” she said. “Alexis Triona,
when you try on a new name and it suits,
wear it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She was so bright that her brilliance would
have dimmed the Celestial Hierarchy or Broadway
at midnight.</p>

<p class='c005'>She clutched him tight. “Oh, my God, if
you had <em>only</em> been killed!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Omit the ‘only’ and it goes,” said he.</p>

<p class='c005'>So they talked through the sweet-scented
June night into the equally deliciously odoriferous
June dawn. And, of course, she, inadvertently,
let slip—the pigs. <i><span lang="la">Magna est lingua
feminae et praevalebit.</span></i> What to do, then?
“Briggs” could be buried but the paternal pigs
pursued her. Alexis rose to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“Come, let’s go,” said he, “let us leave this
snob-ridden island, populated by porcophobes.
Let us go where pigs mean Ancestry, Honors,
Family Portraits, High Society and Money in
the Bank.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Where, oh, where is that delectable place?”
she cried.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Chicago,” he said simply.</p>

    <div><em>An Episode</em></div>
    <div class='c004'><span class='sc'>Far from Sabatini</span></div>

</div>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER IXL</h3>

<p class='c013'>This swiftly executed manœuvre laid the
<em>Saucy Arabella</em> board-and-board the great
Spanish galleon. A dozen grapnels fell and
tore and shivered the timbers of the huge <em>San
Salvador Contra Bonos Mores</em>. A wild, yelling
swarm of boarders swept over the rail—thirty
men against six hundred.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the quarter-deck, Don Dago de Matador
y Mantilla, Lord Admiral of Castille y Sapolio
and grandee of Spain, livid of face, short of
breath, dumb with despair, frantically raged,
as all Spaniards do. Speechless, he shouted
conflicting contradictory commands to his
craven crew. The Spaniards, though outnumbering
the attacking party twenty to one, were
demoralized by the knowledge that these were
Englishmen, entitled to win by all the rules of
the writing game.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Wolverstone, a one-eyed giant with a most
kindly disposition, led the buccaneers. He was
ably seconded by Hagthorpe, a soberly dressed
gentleman, with a clear cut, attractive countenance,
and by a golden-haired, sunny-faced
Somersetshire lad, Jeremy Pitt. Up and down
the waist from the keelson to the plimsoll-mark,
raged these three, treating the Spaniards very
rough, though no blood was shed by either
party.</p>

<p class='c005'>Above them on the quarter-deck, upon which
none of these rough, common sailors thought of
intruding, stood a straight-up-and-down-slip-of-a-girl,
clad in shivering gray silk. Her oval
face, upon which the tropic sun had made no
impression, so permanent was her complexion,
was shaded by the broad brim of a gray hat
garnished with a scarlet austridge ploom. Her
clear hazel eyes sparkled with onwee as she
witnessed the furious onslaught of the invaders
upon the crowded crew.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet for a space, as one might say, the battle
hung uncertain. Push the Spaniards to and
fro as they might, they were so many that the
gallant little band of wild, hairy, half-naked
English pirates could not keep them in order.
It seemed almost impossible that they could
quell the riot without calling out the mounted
police.</p>

<p class='c005'>“One moment, please!” A crisp, metallic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>voice, speaking the purest Castilian, cut across
the tumult like a Toledo blade, beautifully
damascened with golden scarabesques. At the
sound of its master’s voice, the uproar ceased
as suddenly and as completely as it had begun.</p>

<p class='c005'>Arabella, for the young lady on the quarter-deck
was indeed our heroine, gazing with
childish wonder and hazel eyes, saw coming
toward her, picking his way daintily through
that ghastly shambles, a man, tall, lean, graceful,
spruce, modish, etcetera.</p>

<p class='c005'>Peter, for it was none other than he, was unscrupulously
attired in a singularly elegant
costume of crimson satin, trimmed, as it were,
with gold lace. A broad brimmed hat, adorned
with a scarlet feather secured by a brooch, set
with a single great quadroon, which gleamed
dully like a lambent flame, was set above beautifully
marcelled and freshly oiled ringlets of
deepest black, which with a broad linen collar
of finest point, framed a swarthy, tawny, sardonic,
keen, intrepid face and a pair of light
blue eyes, like pale sapphires set in copper.</p>

<p class='c005'>Around his neck like a stole—which it
probably was—he wore a madigral of scarlet
silk, from each end of which hung a silver-mounted
pistol. A gold hilted sword dangled
at his side from a gold embroidered garibaldi.
In his left hand he carried daintily a tall ebony
cane. His stockings were of silk. He wore fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Spinach leather shoes—on his feet. His suspenders
were delicately hand-embroidered and
his undies, though invisible, were doubtless of
equal elegance. He was a very nifty dresser.</p>

<p class='c005'>Moving with easy nonchalance, he came on
until he fronted Don Dago. The light blue
eyes played over the speechless Spaniard like
points of steel. The level black eyebrows went
up. A faint smile curled the lips of the long
mouth and, with a crisp, authoritative, faintly
disdainful manner, blended of suavity, impressiveness
and mockery—not to mention ansooseyance
and savore fare—let alone savore veev
and sang froyd—he spoke in fluent Castilian,
whereof he was master, and with grave courtesy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Admiral, darlint, an’ is it all day yer dirthy
gang o’ cutthroat Spaniards’ll be kapin’ up
this riot? Bedad, we have met again, Don
Dago, and, without offense, I may remark, how
small the world is! Meseems that no one other
than yourself and your brother, Don Miggle,
sails the Spanish Main, so called, for never, forsooth,
do I board a ship without finding eyether
one of you in command, be jabers. Meself ut is
will be askin’ ye to get yer dirthy carcass an’
yer blaggard crew off me ship befoore somebody
gets hurted.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The level black eyebrows, having come down
again in the same place whence they had went
up, came together above the vivid blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Speechless, livid with rage, his mouth distorted
all kind of crooked with anger, the
haughty hidalgo gazed calmly upon the intruder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Off <em>your</em> ship?” he gasped inarticulately.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again in purest Castilian, the elegantly
dressed man spoke.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sure Mike! Is ut ye doan’t know ivry ship’s
<em>my</em> ship when me gang’s wid me? Is it possible
that you are fatuously harboring the delusion
that, with only thirty men against six hundred,
I would be at a loss for a ready expedient
wherewith to bring to fruition my hopes of possessing
this noble vessel? Ah, Admiral, you
have forgotten your Horace—‘<i><span lang="la">Quadrupedante
putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum.</span></i>’ Those
ancient Greeks were very wise, were they not?
Look there, ye dirty scut! Ye miserable blaggard,
look forninst ye!”</p>

<p class='c005'>He waved one hand with elegant languor
toward his gallant crew, which meantime had
gathered in a compact group in the waist just
abaft the rudder. At the signal they drew
aside and disclosed their secret to the astonished
eyes of the affrighted Admiral and his cowardly
minions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Agreeably to a plan concerted beforehand,
these hardy, hairy buccaneers had availed themselves
of the diversion, caused by the entrance
of their leader, to collect all the ship’s ordnance,
its bow-chasers, broadsides and stern-chasers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>and arrange them in a line across the deck,
loaded to their frowning muzzles and trained
full upon the dense mass of Spaniards. There
in an appalling row—behind each gun a gallant
English pirate with lighted penstock in
hand—were ranged nine sackbuts, seven culverts,
four spontoons and two great cuspadores.</p>

<p class='c005'>The glittering dark eyes of Don Dago fell, as
did all the rest of him, upon the deck. With
a fearful groan he expired.</p>

<p class='c005'>The victor turned to the mere-slip-of-a-girl
and spoke in purest Palmolive, whereof he was
master.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Be not alarmed, Miss Bishop. My intentions
are strictly honorable. Object, matrimony.
Not a hair of these men shall touch
your little finger.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her clear hazel eyes regarded him wistfully
and contemptuously and in a steady level voice
she stated “Thief and pirate.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thief and pirate! The cruel phrase filled his
brain, reëchoing and reverberating in its vast
empty spaces. Thief and pirate! Not those!
My God, not those!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Pirate I may be, madam,” he replied stiffly
with admirable candor, “but not thief. For,
know you, that naught have I taken from any
man save in the regular course of piracy. And
more I have to say. Have you observed this
fight? Saw you aught of bloodshed? Did any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>one of these Spanish dogs receive more severe
punishment than a rough push or a sharp slap
mayhap? No, madam, I embarked upon this
career on high moral grounds and have conducted
my piracy along strictly Y. M. C. A.
lines and in the most sanitary manner. You see
before you the only original moral pirate. No
drop of blood stains my name. In all the
Spanish main, I am known and feared as Captain
Bloodless.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She came slowly to him and held out her
hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m&#160;... I’m glad,” she said and strove to
smile (or was it not to smile? Who can tell?).
Won’t you&#160;... won’t you say&#160;... good-by?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Good-by? Shure an’ why should I when
it’s good girl I’d rather be sayin’? Arrah,
ye love me, doan’t ye? Ye’ll marry me,
woan’t ye?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She sank into his arms.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There never, never was a pirate like you,
Peter,” was all she said.</p>

<p class='c005'>So she grew up—twelve, thirteen, fourteen,

<p class='c005'>Simcox then—or Simcox now—the phrases

<p class='c013'>Harry Occleve, now. She knew him slightly.
She despised him. Tame cat! She hated him.

tweed—always so—of tweed, even when in
evening dress. Odd!</p>

<p class='c005'>She met him in her uncle’s house. Poor

He in evening dress.</p>

<p class='c005'>She caught her breath. He caught her in
his arms. Her face upturned—the thing’s too
poignant for the words one has! Really. But
one does one’s best. Start over, then——</p>

<p class='c005'>She was caught in his arms, terribly enfolding
her—around and around and around he
wrapped those long, long strong arms—Phew!
One gets so excited writing it.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was incredibly swooning through incredible
spaces, in incredible seas, through
incredible blackness, in incredible tweedy
smells——</p>

<p class='c005'>Then they went in to dinner.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>She loved him so! Perfect he was. Simply
perfect. Perfectly simple. In every way. A
paragon.</p>

<p class='c005'>He never even swore. Hanging a picture,
he caught his thumb a proper crack with a
hammer, that is to say, he hit it. “Mice
and mumps!” cried Harry. She loved him
so.</p>

<p class='c005'>Oh, rare saying! It epitomized Harry to
her—his only swear word. So perfect he was!
“Mice and mumps!” Never anything stronger.
Never “Rats and rickets!” Never “Snakes
and scarlet-fever.” Never “Terrapins and
tuberculosis!” No. Only “Mice and mumps.”
She loved him so! Oh, rapturous affinity!</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p class='c013'>So they were married. There were children.
She, not cognizant of nature’s dower to her sex,
was surprised. No one had ever told her. Simcox
had never mentioned it. Sturgiss said nothing
about it. How was she to know? One
cannot know everything, and she was so busy at
the office.</p>

<p class='c005'>Three children, happy Huggo, happy
Doda, happy Benji—happy Rosalie—everybody
happy, except Harry. He gloomed sometimes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>glowered sometimes. Brooded now.
Spoke——</p>

<p class='c005'>“Did you ever notice anything queer about
the children?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Ha! What now? Sets the wind in that
quarter? Her defenses bristle.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you ever thought that they are not
<em>quite</em> like other children?”</p>

<p class='c005'>Oh, this was dangerous! Where would this
lead? Oh, dangerous.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Particularize, Harry, particularize!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you ever noticed that Huggo is crosseyed?
Or that Doda has two left feet? and I
think—I <em>think</em> that Benji’s face is on upside
down.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Stand by! Stand by! She has the drift of
this.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, let that go. I have a reply to that!”
A mirage on her face.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What reply?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am a woman!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Unanswerable. He put his arm around
her. “It’s over. It’s over. Let’s forget it,
Rosalie.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER X</h3>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t believe the whale swallowed Jonah!”
Huggo speaking.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>She sat upright. She stared. She called out
dreadfully. Her face was all miraged up.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Huggo!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, mother, you never taught me to
believe it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She drew her hand to her heart. She was
deathly sick. It was very embarrassing.
Huggo! The whale! Jonah!</p>

<p class='c005'>She worked with her fingers at the key ring,
removing her office key.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m coming home, Harry.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Coming home?”—puzzled Harry.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Coming home!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Why, my dear, my dear, steady on! You’re
home already. Mice and mumps! Why, you
came home two hours ago! Why, you—” bewildered
Harry.</p>

<p class='c005'>They carried her up to bed, feet first. She
had an almost fatal mirage.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p class='c013'>So she gave up her job. Spent all her time
with her children. Read them the dear old
things, the kind that mother used to teach,
“Line upon Line,” “Step by Step,” “Mother
Goose,” the Rollo books.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Mice and mumps!” cried Harry, adding
“Mice and mumps!” He was so happy. But
the children? “Dull,” they cried, “deadly dull.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Old stuff! Mid-Victorian! <em>Ab-so-lootly ob-so-lete!</em>
Cut it out, mother dear! Dispense
with it!”</p>

<p class='c005'>She gave it up. Went back to the office.</p>

<p class='c005'>“After all, I <em>am</em> a woman.” She spoke a
mouthful.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p class='c013'>A quick finish now. The Toboggan for
everybody. They’re off!</p>

<p class='c005'>Harry came in. His face iron hard.</p>

<p class='c005'>“What is it, Harry?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s Huggo.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Huggo?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Huggo!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Hug</em>-go?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Huggo!!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Not Huggo?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Huggo!!!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, what?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“In jail for highway robbery.”</p>

<p class='c005'>She went to the bell. “Will you have your
tea now?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tea! Mice and—I mean tea? Why didn’t
you teach that boy that the whale swallowed
Jonah?” His voice like axes thudding. “That’s
the cause of this! How could he know that
highway robbery was wrong, if he didn’t know
the Jonah swal—the whale swallowed Jonah?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Why didn’t you tell him that well-known fact?”</p>

<p class='c005'>She looked at him, miragically, as usual. “I’ll
tell you why. <em>I am a woman!</em>”</p>

<p class='c005'>Bull’s-eye! The perfect answer! He put his
arm around her.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come, let’s forget it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She saw Huggo in prison. “Why did you
do it, Huggo?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“My name’s Hugh. Everybody at home
called me that awful name. I couldn’t stick it.
I’d rather be in jail.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Strike one!</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p class='c013'>Doda now. Her turn. The less said the
better. But one must say something. Say—Doda,
then, baby girl, tiny daughter. That’ll
do to start it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Say—look, there she is! She’s fourteen.
Look, there she is! She’s sixteen. Look, there
she is! She’s eighteen. That’ll help out a bit.</p>

<p class='c005'>Say—Dances. Untidiness. Powder on her
nose. No Jonah in her head. That’ll do to
fill in.</p>

<p class='c005'>Say—look, there she is! She’s dead. That’ll
finish her.</p>

<p class='c005'>The less said, the better.</p>

Her wee one. One should have mentioned that
his name was Benji.</p>

<p class='c005'>Little Benji collides with a train. It isn’t a

<p class='c005'>But, the result is the same—Benji dies. She

<p class='c005'>Therefore, he’s dead.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>I</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Crabtree family is ancient and honorable.
Though the beginnings of the American
branch are obscure, the family’s origin is undoubted.
Its founder was the well-known
Adam Crabtree, a landed proprietor whose
country estate was notable for its extent and
magnificence, but especially for a certain
famous tree, which bore beautiful but bitter
apples, called crabs, whence the family took
its name. He had perhaps the largest private
zoölogical garden ever assembled, unequaled
for completeness, until one of his descendants,
Noah Crabtree, built up his collection.</p>

<p class='c005'>Adam Crabtree lived in Eden, Mesopotamia,
where, in 4004 B. C., he married his
second wife, Eve Sparerib. Their third son,
Seth, was the ancestor of the American branch
of the family.</p>

<p class='c005'>Though a man of large means, Adam Crabtree’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>taste in dress was simple. He commonly
wore only a sort of sporran made of fig-leaves.
His second wife, Eve, was more given to dress
than his first, Lilith, but was really unostentatious.
Her costume was a mere surcingle of
the same material, edged with scallops of
geraniums. It is regrettable that her quiet
taste was not inherited by her American
descendants.</p>

<p class='c005'>The dominant family trait of restlessness
was early displayed in the departure of the
Adam Crabtrees from Eden, shortly after their
marriage. Longevity was also a characteristic,
emphasized in the case of old Methuselah
Crabtree. At the time of his death he was the
oldest inhabitant of his home town.</p>

<p class='c005'>Noah Crabtree was an eminent shipmaster.
He was the genius who put the ark in archæology.
Successive Crabtrees kept on the move,
Arphaxad, grandson of Noah, Terah, his descendant
in the seventh generation, and Abraham,
son of Terah, were notable travelers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Abraham’s great-grandson was the first
Reuben Crabtree. The first to engage in the
business so successfully conducted years afterward
in San Francisco, the dealing in spices,
was Solomon Crabtree, an importer in a large
way of business.</p>

<p class='c005'>The coming of the family to England, whence
the founder of the American branch emigrated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>is wrapped in the mists of history. But at the
Round Table, it seems, the family was represented
by the knight known by the family’s
commonest pseudonym, Bors.</p>

<p class='c005'>Throughout this distinguished line of ancestors
there were displayed the Crabtree characteristics
of longevity, frequent change of
abode, large families and complicated kinships.
These are especially observable in the Earlier
Eastern line but persist remarkably to the
present day. No Crabtree can ever confidently
state his relationship to any other without consulting
the family tree, which each carries about
with him.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>II</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Reuben Crabtree family mansion at
San Rafael was a large house with three floors
and as many ceilings. It also had a cellar,
four walls, a roof, numerous bay-windows, a
kitchen and a sink. It was fully furnished with
chairs, tables, beds, bureaus, carpets, wallpapers,
stationary washstands and daughters.
It was surrounded, as well as inhabited, by wallflowers,
also by syringas, fuchsias and fences.</p>

<p class='c005'>Reuben’s daughter, May Brewer, lived in the
house and was responsible for its upkeep, also,
in part, for the daughters. Mrs. Brewer had
a high bosom and many fine costumes, descriptions
of which may be found in <cite>Godey’s Lady’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Book</cite> and <cite>Harper’s Bazaar</cite> of appropriate
dates.</p>

<p class='c005'>The chief occupation of the Brewer household
was husband hunting. Just what the girls
would do with their husbands after they were
caught, they did not know, having been brought
up very carefully.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tina,” said Vicky, who wore a figured
lavender foulard, pleated and flounced over a
small bustle, its skirts sweeping the ground, its
tight sleeve ending below the elbow and above
the wrist, the other sleeve doing the same, “do
you think Vernon Yelland will marry you?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” answered Tina, who wore a girlish
white muslin and no bustle, her broad uncorseted
waist merely indicated by a sash of satin
ribbon, “I’ve looked at the family tree and find
that he has to marry Grace Fairchild first, but
that she will die in 1894 and then he marries
me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a long time to wait,” said Esme, in a
pleated pink challis gown, trimmed with blue
cashmere, cut on the bias, hemstitched with
broad bands of guipure lace, with flounces of
dimity and old rose brocade.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said Tina, “but it’s a cinch at that,
compared with your chance or Vicky’s.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A what, my dear?” asked her mother, who
wore a costume of purple cloth, ornamented
with festoons of flowered satine <i><span lang="fr">en brochette</span></i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>from which hung elegant tabs of peau de soie,
garnished with paillettes of crimson plush and
organdie, the panniers cut <i><span lang="fr">en train</span></i> and looped
over the bustle with ropes of blue sarsenet,
pleated with rosemary chenille. “Do not let
Mamma hear you use that naughty word again.
Say—‘I’m sorry, Mamma.’”</p>

<p class='c005'>Lou, the fourth daughter, clad in scarlet tapestry,
trimmed with jet chignons and basques of
green corduroy, interrupted the conversation.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Sh-h-h! there’s someone coming up the
drive.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A man?” they cried in unison.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I think so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“To your stations, girls!” said their mother.
“Whose turn is it to-day?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Vicky’s,” said Esme reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c005'>Vicky seized the lasso which hung ready to
hand and, clambering through the window,
stretched herself prone upon the porch roof,
over the front steps. Her mother, holding the
end of the rope, braced herself against the window sill
for a strong pull at the proper moment.</p>

<p class='c005'>The others scurried down the back-stairs and
circled the house. Two of them took up positions
in the shrubbery bordering the drive,
Esme with a shot-gun, Lou with a pitchfork, to
prevent the evasion of their prey. Tina reached
the gate unseen, closed it, locked it and chained
to it the man-eating watch-dog.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>There was a moment of tense excitement,
then Esme’s voice calling, “Sold again, Vicky.
It’s only Papa.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Brewer approached the house. His face
was simply dressed in a full beard, <i><span lang="fr">à la Russe</span></i>,
garnished with sidewhiskers of the same.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Anybody married since I left this morning?”
he asked hopefully. There was no response.
A look of deep melancholy overspread his features,
his shoulders sagged visibly, the wrinkles
in his bombazine coat showed plainly his
desperation.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III</h3>

<p class='c013'>Aunt Fanny and Aunt Lucy came over to
San Rafael to spend the day. They had taken
the nine-forty-five ferry to Sausalito and the
ten-thirty train hence. There had been a
change in the schedule the previous week, the
boat formerly leaving at nine-forty now left
at nine-forty-five, and the train, whose time
had been ten-fifteen, now departed at ten-thirty.
They had with difficulty adjusted themselves
to these innovations.</p>

<p class='c005'>All the female members of the Brewer family
and their guests were assembled in the
parlor. The Brewer girls ranged in age from
twenty-four to twenty-eight years.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aunt Fanny was an old maid with a flexible
nose, which, when agitated, she used to beat.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>By the intervals between the blows and by
their force, one could measure the depth of her
agitation. She wore a blue foulard, trimmed
with camel’s hair, flounced with calico and
broadcloth and ornamented with passementrie
and passepartout in contrasting colors.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aunt Lucy was garbed in a crazy-quilt which
she had made out of her former husband’s
discarded neckties.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Brewer and the girls wore the dresses
described in the previous chapter.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Have you heard of Amelia lately?” asked
Mrs. Brewer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who is Amelia?” asked Vicky, aged twenty-eight.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Vicky, dearest, you shouldn’t ask Mamma
such questions,” chided Mrs. Brewer. “Mamma
doesn’t like it. Amelia is your third cousin
once removed, the daughter of Aunt Caroline’s
first husband, who was the son of his father,
one of the Brewers of Milwaukee.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“No,” replied Aunt Fanny, beating her nose
gently. “But Rebecca’s mother, who was old
Hannibal Crabtree’s niece by his marriage to
Belinda Johnson, the sister of Cicero Tompkins,
who was divorced from her uncle’s sister.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What about her?” said Esme.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nothing,” answered Fanny.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How do you make that delicious fruit cake,
May?” asked Lucy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“Two cups of flour, four eggs, a spoonful
of saleratus and two cups of horseradish.
Break the eggs gently, add the gravy drop by
drop, stir from left to right. Let it simmer on
the back of the stove for two days and fry in
a colander over a slow fire,” said May.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lou,” interjected Tina. “Did you know
our cat has kittens?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Teeny-weeny!</em>” cried her mother. “Don’t
you know that such things should never be
alluded to in Mamma’s presence? Mamma is
deeply grieved. Perhaps a few days in your
room on bread and water will be needed.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Mamma,” said Tina meekly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“How about Pa Crabtree?” asked Mrs.
Brewer of Fanny. “Any prospects of his dying
soon?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m afraid not,” said Fanny, beating her
nose staccato. “He does hang on so.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Girls,” said Mrs. Brewer, “go out on the
porch for a few minutes.” Obediently they
trooped out.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Is—Alice?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” said Lucy, “December.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And—Nellie?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“November.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“And—Dessie?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“October.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Lola is—January,” said Mrs. Brewer.
“Mrs. Yelland, February and Mrs. Torrey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>March. The cat, yesterday. I hope my
daughters will never be so unladylike.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Aunt Fanny beat her nose violently, expressing
chagrin.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Come in, girls,” called Mamma. “Tell
Auntie Fanny how you make that delightful
new salad.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Four cups of vinegar,” began Vicky, “a
pound of macaroons, nine artichokes, two peppers
and a turnip. Crumble the eggs in a
warming pan, add the glycerine, chop the tomatoes
into small pieces and serve in patty-pans
garnished with ostrich feathers.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How lovely,” said Lucy.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This whole thing,” whispered Lou to Tina,
“sounds to me like two pages out of the <cite>Ladies’
Home Journal</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Father’s footsteps were heard in the hall.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Anybody married yet?” he asked. “Hello,
Fanny. Is your Pa dead?” He read the answers
in their faces, groaned audibly and left
the room.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IV</h3>

<p class='c013'>It was a fine bright day in the latter part of
the last chapter. May Brewer and Stephen,
her husband, were busy in the kitchen. She
washed the dishes at the sink. He dried them.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” said she, “it’s about finished.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes,” he replied, “Esme’s dead. Vicky’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>working her head off at Napa to keep the wolf
from their door. Tina’s married to a poor
preacher and has three step-children beside her
own brood. Lou married that old fellow in
Buenos Aires. Bertie’s thoroughly unhappy
with his wife. Lucy’s left Harry and he’s
living on George. Nelly’s husband is a drunkard.
Alice’s beats her. Bob’s wife’s dead. The
family business is bankrupt, and I’ve got nothing
to do but wash dishes in this mortgaged
house and live on remittances from Lou’s husband.
It’s been a great life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“There are compensations, dear,” said May.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, to be sure,” admitted Stephen. “Your
Pa’s dead. That helps some.”</p>

had. Adam Larey’s face flushed beneath its
coat of tan and his breath came in short pants,
for he was clothed in the innocence of eighteen
summers. Though his lofty stature betokened
budding manhood, Adam Larey had never before
spoken to a woman other than his mother
or an occasional sister.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, suddenly, Margarita launched herself
upon him. Her slender twining form enveloped
him like a wind of flame, like a lissom spectre.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>A strong shuddering shook his heart. His
blood leaped, beat, burnt in his veins. He was
gathered in her close embrace.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t! don’t!” he gasped. “You mustn’t!
Someone will see——”</p>

<p class='c005'>His words were stifled by those eager searching
lips and—<em>she kissed him</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was over in a single, scorching, flaming
moment. Exerting his enormous strength to the
utmost, he tore himself from her twining arms,
half ran, half stumbled up the rocky path to
his cabin, flung himself upon his bed and burst
into a blinding flood of tears.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>II</h3>

<p class='c013'>Adam Larey’s aching eyelids opened on the
cold gray dawn of the morning after. Simultaneously,
the dread realization of his loss
overwhelmed him, devastated him, made him
feel very bad. He had been through the fires of
passion, through the flames of dishonor. He
could never, never be the same pure man again
as previously he had been before. She must
atone. She must marry him, make an honest
man of him.</p>

<p class='c005'>He found her in converse with his brother
Guerd Larey—tall, superbly built, handsome,
bold, keen, reckless, gay Guerd Larey—whose
face was perfect of feature, not a single one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>missing—Guerd Larey, a creature of G—dlike
beauty, with a heart as false as h—l!!</p>

<p class='c005'>“Margarita! Maggie! Mag!” he faltered.
“Will you—won’t you—ain’t you going to—marry
me? After what happened—last night—you
won’t, will you?—I mean, you will, won’t
you? You ain’t chucked me, are you? I’m
on, ain’t I? You can’t can me, can you? Aw!
You know what I mean!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Nachitoches, señor!</em>” she answered lightly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Meaning?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Nay—no—not—nix—never—not at all—nothing
doing—and several other expressions of
like import,” said she.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ha! ha!” commented Guerd Larey.</p>

<p class='c005'>His mocking tones roused all the d—vil in
the breast of Adam Larey.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Take care, Guerd Larey!” he said omnivorously.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Say not so, Adam! say not so!” taunted
Guerd Larey, and at the same time seized a
huge rock of several hundred-weight and hurled
it at his brother. It struck Adam Larey full in
the face and dazed him for a moment.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then a rushing gush of rage overwhelmed
him. He snatched his gun from its holster.</p>

<p class='c005'>“You have snore your last sneer, Guerd
Larey!” he cried, closed both eyes and pulled
the trigger—or whatever you call that little
thing that makes it shoot—turned and fled to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the desert—the registered trade-mark of Cain
upon him.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>III</h3>

<p class='c013'>Adam Larey’s dull eyelids opened on the
grim, dim dawn of the zanegrey desert. Before
him a wide, barren, endless, bleak, lifeless,
silent, desolate plateau—illimitable space and
silence and solitude and desolation stretched
illimitably to a illimitable horizon—wild and
black and sharp—colossal buttresses, chocolate
mountain ranges, bare and jagged peaks,
silhouetted against the hazel dawn.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here and there were sparse, vague tufts of
sage-brush, greasewood, sneezewood, <em>cacti</em>,
<em>neckti</em>, <em>octopi</em>, <em>ocatilla</em>, <em>ocarina</em> and similar
hardy perennials—the strange verbiage of the
desert.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the left, lofty Pistachio lifted its pale
green peak. On the right Eskimopi, in lofty
grandeur, heaved its chocolate height.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IV</h3>

<p class='c013'>Two weeks had elapsed since Adam Larey
had flown the coop. Two weeks without food,
without water, had left him both hungry and
thirsty. Punctured by cactus-spines, his boots
had suffered several important blow-outs and
now he was traveling practically on his rims.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>More than fifty miles a day he had fled over
the desert floor, composed chiefly of sand,
gravel, lime, cement and other building materials,
yet every one of the last ten nights he
had slept in the same place.</p>

<p class='c005'>Morning after morning, he had set out. Day
after day, he had followed his own trail, now a
broad, well-beaten track. Night after night,
he had reached the same starting point. <em>The
doom of the desert had fallen on the wanderer.</em>
<span class='sc'>He was traveling in a circle.</span></p>

<h3 class='c014'>V</h3>

<p class='c013'>The blazing disc of the sun mounted the coppery
sky—the lord of day ascending the throne
of this, his empire. The desert seemed aflame,
when Adam Larey set out on his daily round.
The rocks were hot as red-hot plates of iron or
steel. The sand was very warm, also.</p>

<p class='c005'>And now a low, seeping, silken rustle filled
the air, sometimes rising to a soft roar—the
dread simoom of the desert! It whipped up the
sand in clouds, sheets, blankets, quilts, mattresses,
till all the air was pale yellow, thick and
opaque and moaning. It was hot with the heat
of a blast-furnace, heavy with the weight of
leaden fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>It burned Adam Larey’s brow, charred his
cheeks and baked his brains—seared, scorched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the rest of him. His blood was boiling in his
head. His motometer burst, steam issued from
his ears and there was no water to replenish
his radiator. Still doggedly Adam Larey strove
forward.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fiercer and hotter blew the wind. His hair
was ignited. His celluloid collar button exploded.
His shirt was charred to tinder. His
suspender buttons melted. His trousers fell
from him. Still doggedly Adam Larey strove
forward.</p>

<p class='c005'>Fiercer and hotter blew the wind. His skin
dried, shriveled, was calcined, blew away in
dust. His flesh followed. As deep inroads were
thus made in his muscular substance, unarticulated
bones, having no means of support, were
detached and fell from him. Still doggedly
Adam Larey strove forward.</p>

<p class='c005'>But when both knee-caps dropped and his
knee-joints worked with equal ease forward or
backward, even he could no more. The skeleton
of Adam Larey fell rattling to the ground.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VI</h3>

<p class='c013'>There Dismukes, the old prospector, found
him. It was a heart-breaking job to rebuild
Adam Larey—to find the missing parts. But
the pertinacity of the old prospector was rewarded.
Adam Larey’s chassis was re-assembled.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>A few cups of soup were administered,
carefully at first because the gas-tank leaked,
and at last Adam Larey, re-built, re-finished
throughout, stood erect once more.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dismukes gave him a new outfit, including a
burro, showed him how to pack the burro
neatly, so the drawers would close, and Adam
Larey set out again on his travels.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>VII</h3>

<p class='c013'>Eight years Adam Larey dwelt in the desert,
growing daily stronger, finer, purer in its
illimitable wilds—the abode of purity, silence
and tarantulas. Climbing inaccessible heights,
striding over impassable plains, stalking the
savage antelope, the impatient grizzly, the
querulous bob-cat, he acquired the eye of a
mountain-sheep, the ear of a deer, the nose of
a wolf and many other trophies of the chase.</p>

<p class='c005'>He loved the lure of the desert. He learned
its lore. The secrets of nature were disclosed
to him. He knew whether the antelope chews
her cud with a full set of teeth, upper and
lower, or has to gum it in part—why grizzly-bears
always walk in single file and why they
never do—why the bark of a coyote or of a
tree, whichever it is, is always rougher on the
north or the south side, as the case may be—wherein
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the joyous cry of the great blue condor,
weeping for its children, differs from the
melancholy note of the lounge lizard courting
its mate—whether the gray desert wolf is indigenous,
like the horned toad, or monogamous,
like the rattlesnake—whether the jack-rabbit’s
tail curls in the direction of the movement of
hands of a watch, like the trailing arbutus, or
counter-clockwise, like the lesser celandine—whether
the giraffe lies down to sleep or merely
appears to do so—whether the mesquite-bush
attracts lightning or whether it is the lightning’s
own fault—whether sound travels faster in the
direction in which it is going or in the opposite
direction—whether the vulture finds carrion
by the odor emanating from its prey or by its
own sense of smell—whether the bob-cat can
see in the dark as well or not as well or better
or worse or at all or not at all or at night or
partially or impartially or which, if any—Adam
Larey at last knew the answers to all
these questions as well as Stewart Edward
White or any Boy Scout in America.</p>

<p class='c005'>He had adopted the name of Woncefell—in
memory of his single lapse from virtue, his
momentary liaison with Margarita, the Maid
of Muchacho. As Woncefell, the Wanderer,
he was known and feared throughout that desert
land.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>VIII</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Death Valley! Surrounded by ragged,
jagged peaks, floored with ashes, borax, sandsoap,
dutch-cleanser, watered by arsenic
springs, swept by furnace blasts, it was, indeed,
an unpleasant place. “The lid of h—ll,”
a profane prospector had called it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet there, in a rude shack on the sloping
mountain side, overhung by an impending mass
of loose rock, from which ever and anon gigantic
fragments detached themselves to roll
with a booming crash into the valley below,
missing the cabin only by inches, dwelt
Magdalene Virey and Elliott, her husband.</p>

<p class='c005'>She was a woman of noble proportions,
though frail—at least she had been on one occasion.
She suffered from insomnia because
Elliott spent his nights in the mass of rocks
above the cabin, detaching great boulders and
rolling them down with a booming crash into
the valley below, trying to frighten his wife to
death.</p>

<p class='c005'>Elliott did not love his wife and he was a
very disagreeable man. He was, perhaps, a
little mad, but his wife never got that way.
She had a very sweet forgiving nature. The
great boulders always narrowly missed the tiny
cabin. They bounded over, knocking the top
off the chimney, and she had to rebuild it every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>morning. But the sad-eyed saint never
complained.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>IX</h3>

<p class='c013'>Thither came Woncefell, the Wanderer.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Magdalene Virey, why do you dwell in this
horrible place?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Woncefell, the Wanderer,” she answered,
“I love the silence, the loneliness, the mystery
of the great open spaces and, besides, dear
Elliott finds his rock-golf so amusing. He is
so ambitious to make the chimney in one.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I can endure it only because I am sustained
by my faith in G—d and by the hope that some
night he’ll break his dod-gasted neck or pinch
his fingers or something.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Magdalene Virey,” he said, “why does he
do it?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Woncefell, the Wanderer,” she said, “because
my daughter Ruth is not Elliott Virey’s
daughter.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Magdalene Virey, who <em>is</em> Elliott Virey’s
daughter, then?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Woncefell, the Wanderer, I do not know,”
she answered.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Magdalene Virey, my G—d!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Who <em>was</em> Elliott Virey’s daughter? The
mystery was insoluble. It was plain to him
now that he must kill Elliott Virey with his
bare hands, like he had killed Baldy McKue,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>breaking his arms, one at a time, then his legs,
then his ribs <em>seriatim</em>, then his neck—and that
was about all.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>X</h3>

<p class='c013'>That night Elliott Virey engaged as usual in
his favorite outdoor sport. Rock after rock,
boulder and yet more bould, crashed, streaked,
hurtled down the mountain. Singly, in pairs,
in column of fours, in mass formation, by
dozens and hundreds, they crashed and boomed
as the madman hurled them at the humble
dwelling of his lawful wife.</p>

<p class='c005'>The time had come! Adam Larey started up
the slope.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Virey</em>,” he roared above the thunder of the
rocks, “<em>I’m going to break your bones like I
done Baldy McKue’s</em>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The madman heard him.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em>Fore!</em>” he yelled and with one last supreme
effort tore loose the whole mountain side.
Down it came with a thunderous roar, a cataclysmic
rush, and with it came Virey. It
swept the cabin from its underpinning.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the mass of rocks bearing the little shack
crashed past Adam Larey, the saintly woman
leaned far out o’er the window sill and handed
him a small photograph.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Woncefell, the Wanderer,” she said in a
low, clear voice, “take it. It is my daughter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>my child, not Elliott’s. With the clairvoyant
truth given to a dying woman, I tell you that
you and she will meet. Go find her. And now,
I do not know where we’re going but we’re
certainly on our way. You’ll excuse my leaving
you, won’t you? Her name is Ruth. <i><span lang="fr">Au
revoir!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What a pretty name,” said Adam Larey,
musingly, as the avalanche and Mr. and Mrs.
Virey spilled over into the declivity below, lifting
to heaven a thick, crashing, rolling roar of
thunder. When the last rumble died away,
silence and solitude reigned over all. Adam
Larey was alone at last.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>XI</h3>

<p class='c013'>He did meet Ruth on page 392. Her mother
had evidently been reading ahead.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh, you Sheik,” she said. “Desert man, I
am lonesome. Stay—stay, desert man, and
make me a woman.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Gosh! wasn’t she awful? Adam Larey fled.
The younger generation was too much for him.
Besides, he had yet to atone for his brother’s
death—to surrender to the sheriff, be hanged
for murder—then, only then, would his conscience
cease its seventeen years’ bickering—then,
only then, could he return and claim her
for his bride.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>
  <h3 class='c014'>XII</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Muchacho again—the scene of his boyhood—and
his old friend, Merrywell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Old friend,” said Adam Larey, “lead me to
my brother’s grave.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“His grave?” said Merrywell. “Gosh! he
ain’t got none, as I knows on.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What?” cried Adam Larey. “Why didn’t
they bury him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“’Cause he ain’t dead yit.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Didn’t I kill him?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Gosh, no! Your pistol missed fire. Guerd
Larey’s ’live as you be.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Do you mean to say,” cried Adam Larey,
“that I’ve been expiating Guerd Larey’s death
in the desert for seventeen years with sandstorms
and tarantulas and everything, and he
ain’t dead? This is an outrage! Somebody’ll
pay for this!”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Go easy, young man,” said Merrywell.
“Ain’t you been workin’ fer Mr. Zane Grey?
Well, don’t you know as Mr. Grey don’t never
let his heroes do nothin’ ’at’s really bad?”</p>

<h3 class='c014'><em>NOTES</em></h3>

<p class='c013'>Not only the title but the plan and a good deal
of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested
by Mr. T. S. Eliot’s poem <cite>The Waste Land</cite>.
Indeed, so deeply am I indebted, Mr. Eliot’s poem
will elucidate the difficulties of my poem much
better than my notes can do; and I recommend it
(apart from the amusement to be derived from it)
because my poem will seem more lucid by contrast.</p>

<p class='c005'>Following Mr. Eliot’s example, I have availed
myself of the work of fellow bards. Credit has not
been given in these notes in every case, but will be
extended freely on application to our Credit Department.</p>
